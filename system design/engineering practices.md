## Refactoring

### Definition and Principles
Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior. The goal is to improve code readability, reduce complexity, and make the codebase more maintainable.

### Core Refactoring Principles
- **Red-Green-Refactor Cycle**: Write failing test (red), make it pass (green), then refactor
- **Small Steps**: Make incremental changes to minimize risk
- **Preserve Behavior**: Ensure external functionality remains unchanged
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain comprehensive tests throughout the process

### Common Refactoring Techniques

#### Extract Method
Break down large methods into smaller, more focused functions.

```python
# Before
def process_order(order):
    # Calculate total
    total = 0
    for item in order.items:
        total += item.price * item.quantity
    
    # Apply discount
    if order.customer.is_premium:
        total *= 0.9
    
    # Send confirmation
    email_service.send(order.customer.email, f"Order total: ${total}")

# After
def process_order(order):
    total = calculate_total(order)
    total = apply_discount(total, order.customer)
    send_confirmation(order.customer, total)
```

#### Extract Class
When a class has too many responsibilities, extract some into a new class.

#### Rename Variables/Methods
Use descriptive names that clearly express intent.

#### Remove Duplicated Code
Consolidate repeated logic into shared functions or classes.

### When to Refactor
- **Before Adding Features**: Clean up the area where you'll be working
- **During Code Reviews**: Address technical debt as you discover it
- **Performance Issues**: Optimize after profiling identifies bottlenecks
- **Maintenance Windows**: Dedicated time for improving code quality

### Refactoring Anti-patterns
- **Big Bang Refactoring**: Attempting to refactor everything at once
- **Refactoring Without Tests**: Changing code without safety nets
- **Premature Optimization**: Optimizing before measuring performance
- **Over-engineering**: Making code more complex than necessary

## Legacy Code Management

### Understanding Legacy Code
Legacy code is often characterized by:
- Lack of automated tests
- Poor documentation
- Outdated dependencies
- Tight coupling between components
- Inconsistent coding standards

### Strategies for Working with Legacy Code

#### The Legacy Code Dilemma
To safely change legacy code, you need tests. But to add tests, you often need to change the code. This creates a chicken-and-egg problem.

#### Breaking Dependencies
Use these techniques to make legacy code testable:

**Dependency Injection**
```java
// Before (hard to test)
public class OrderProcessor {
    private PaymentService paymentService = new PaymentService();
    
    public void processOrder(Order order) {
        paymentService.processPayment(order.getTotal());
    }
}

// After (testable)
public class OrderProcessor {
    private PaymentService paymentService;
    
    public OrderProcessor(PaymentService paymentService) {
        this.paymentService = paymentService;
    }
    
    public void processOrder(Order order) {
        paymentService.processPayment(order.getTotal());
    }
}
```

**Seams and Wrapper Classes**
Create wrapper classes around difficult-to-test external dependencies.

#### Characterization Tests
Write tests that capture the current behavior of the system, even if it's not the desired behavior. These tests serve as a safety net while refactoring.

#### The Strangler Fig Pattern
Gradually replace legacy functionality by:
1. Creating new functionality alongside the old
2. Redirecting traffic to the new system
3. Removing old code once it's no longer used

### Legacy Code Migration Strategies

#### Incremental Migration
- **Feature Flags**: Use toggles to gradually roll out new functionality
- **Branch by Abstraction**: Create an abstraction layer to switch between old and new implementations
- **Database Migration**: Gradually migrate data while maintaining backward compatibility

#### Risk Management
- **Rollback Plans**: Always have a way to revert changes
- **Canary Deployments**: Test changes with a small subset of users first
- **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive logging and alerting

## Continuous Delivery

### Core Principles
Continuous Delivery (CD) is the practice of keeping your codebase in a deployable state at all times, with automated pipelines that can safely deliver changes to production.

### Key Components

#### Continuous Integration (CI)
- **Automated Builds**: Every code change triggers a build
- **Automated Testing**: Comprehensive test suites run on every commit
- **Fast Feedback**: Developers get quick feedback on their changes
- **Trunk-based Development**: Work on short-lived branches or directly on main

#### Deployment Pipeline
A typical CD pipeline includes:

1. **Source Control Trigger**: Pipeline starts when code is committed
2. **Build Stage**: Compile code and create artifacts
3. **Unit Test Stage**: Run fast, isolated tests
4. **Integration Test Stage**: Test component interactions
5. **Security Scanning**: Check for vulnerabilities
6. **Performance Testing**: Validate system performance
7. **Staging Deployment**: Deploy to production-like environment
8. **Production Deployment**: Automated or one-click deployment

#### Configuration Management
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Define infrastructure using code (Terraform, CloudFormation)
- **Environment Parity**: Keep development, staging, and production environments similar
- **Externalized Configuration**: Store environment-specific settings outside code

### Deployment Strategies

#### Blue-Green Deployment
Maintain two identical production environments:
- **Blue**: Current production environment
- **Green**: New version deployment target
- Switch traffic between environments for zero-downtime deployments

#### Rolling Deployment
Gradually replace old instances with new ones:
- Deploy to a subset of servers
- Verify functionality
- Continue rolling out to remaining servers

#### Canary Deployment
Deploy to a small percentage of users first:
- Route small percentage of traffic to new version
- Monitor metrics and user feedback
- Gradually increase traffic to new version

### Monitoring and Observability in CD

#### Key Metrics
- **Deployment Frequency**: How often you deploy to production
- **Lead Time**: Time from code commit to production deployment
- **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)**: How quickly you recover from failures
- **Change Failure Rate**: Percentage of deployments causing production issues

#### Automated Monitoring
- **Health Checks**: Automated verification of system health
- **Rollback Triggers**: Automatically revert deployments when issues are detected
- **Alert Systems**: Notify teams of deployment issues immediately

## Code Quality and Testing

### Testing Strategy

#### Test Pyramid
Structure your tests in a pyramid shape:
- **Unit Tests (70%)**: Fast, isolated tests for individual components
- **Integration Tests (20%)**: Test component interactions
- **End-to-End Tests (10%)**: Test complete user workflows

#### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
1. **Red**: Write a failing test
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to make the test pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests green

#### Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
Write tests in natural language that describe system behavior:
```gherkin
Feature: User login
  Scenario: Successful login
    Given a user with valid credentials
    When they attempt to log in
    Then they should be redirected to the dashboard
```

### Code Quality Metrics

#### Static Analysis
- **Code Coverage**: Percentage of code covered by tests
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Measure of code complexity
- **Technical Debt**: Quantify shortcuts and suboptimal solutions
- **Code Duplication**: Identify repeated code patterns

#### Code Review Practices
- **Peer Reviews**: Have code reviewed by team members
- **Automated Checks**: Use tools to enforce coding standards
- **Small Pull Requests**: Keep changes focused and reviewable
- **Documentation**: Include clear descriptions of changes

## Version Control Best Practices

### Git Workflow Strategies

#### GitFlow
- **Master**: Production-ready code
- **Develop**: Integration branch for features
- **Feature Branches**: Individual feature development
- **Release Branches**: Preparation for production releases
- **Hotfix Branches**: Emergency fixes to production

#### GitHub Flow
Simpler workflow for continuous deployment:
1. Create feature branch from main
2. Make changes and push to branch
3. Open pull request
4. Merge to main after review
5. Deploy immediately

### Commit Best Practices

#### Commit Messages
Follow conventional commit format:
```
type(scope): description

feat(auth): add OAuth2 integration
fix(api): resolve null pointer exception
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

#### Atomic Commits
- Each commit should represent a single logical change
- Commits should be self-contained and buildable
- Use interactive rebase to clean up commit history

---

## Architecture and Design

### Design Principles

#### SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: A class should have only one reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Software entities should be open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
- **Interface Segregation**: Clients shouldn't depend on interfaces they don't use
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

#### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- **Ubiquitous Language**: Shared vocabulary between technical and business teams
- **Bounded Contexts**: Clear boundaries between different parts of the system
- **Aggregates**: Consistent boundaries for data changes
- **Domain Services**: Business logic that doesn't belong to entities

### Architectural Patterns

#### Microservices
Benefits:
- Independent deployment and scaling
- Technology diversity
- Team autonomy
- Fault isolation

Challenges:
- Network complexity
- Data consistency
- Testing complexity
- Operational overhead

#### Event-Driven Architecture
- **Event Sourcing**: Store all changes as events
- **CQRS**: Separate read and write models
- **Message Queues**: Asynchronous communication between services

## Monitoring and Observability

### Three Pillars of Observability

#### Logging
- **Structured Logging**: Use consistent, parseable log formats
- **Log Levels**: Appropriate use of DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR
- **Contextual Information**: Include relevant metadata in logs
- **Centralized Logging**: Aggregate logs from all services

#### Metrics
- **Business Metrics**: Track key business indicators
- **Technical Metrics**: Monitor system performance and health
- **Custom Metrics**: Application-specific measurements
- **Dashboards**: Visual representation of system state

#### Tracing
- **Distributed Tracing**: Track requests across multiple services
- **Performance Analysis**: Identify bottlenecks in request processing
- **Error Analysis**: Understand failure patterns
- **Dependency Mapping**: Visualize service interactions

### Alerting Best Practices
- **Actionable Alerts**: Only alert on issues requiring immediate action
- **Alert Fatigue**: Avoid too many alerts that get ignored
- **Escalation Policies**: Define who gets notified and when
- **Runbooks**: Document response procedures for common alerts

---

## Documentation and Knowledge Sharing

### Types of Documentation

#### Code Documentation
- **API Documentation**: Clear interface specifications
- **Inline Comments**: Explain complex logic, not obvious code
- **README Files**: Project setup and basic usage instructions
- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**: Document important design decisions

#### Process Documentation
- **Deployment Guides**: Step-by-step deployment instructions
- **Troubleshooting Guides**: Common issues and solutions
- **Onboarding Documentation**: Help new team members get started
- **Incident Response Procedures**: Clear protocols for handling outages

### Knowledge Sharing Practices

#### Code Reviews
- Share knowledge through review discussions
- Use reviews as teaching opportunities
- Document review feedback for future reference

#### Tech Talks and Learning Sessions
- Regular knowledge sharing sessions
- Lightning talks on new technologies
- Post-mortem meetings to learn from incidents
