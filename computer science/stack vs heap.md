Great question 👍 Let’s break down both parts:

---

### 🔹 **Memory Locality**

Memory locality means **how close data is stored in memory** so the CPU can access it quickly.
There are two main kinds:

1. **Spatial locality** → if you access one piece of data, you’re likely to access nearby data soon.

   * Example: an array on the **stack**.

     ```c
     int arr[5] = {1,2,3,4,5};
     ```

     These integers are stored **contiguously** (side by side) in memory, so iterating over them is very fast.
     The CPU can fetch several into cache at once.

2. **Temporal locality** → if you use some data now, you’ll probably use it again soon.

   * Example: a variable used repeatedly in a loop.

✅ **Stack usually has good locality** because values are laid out next to each other in memory and reused in predictable ways.
❌ **Heap often has poor locality** because allocations can be scattered all over memory, depending on what else the program or OS is doing.

---

### 🔹 **Storage of values outside of function calls (Heap)**

This means **heap memory is not tied to the lifetime of a function call**.

* On the **stack**:

  * Variables live only until the function returns.
  * Example:

    ```c
    void foo() {
        int x = 10; // stored on stack
    } // x disappears here
    ```

* On the **heap**:

  * Variables stay alive until you explicitly free them (C/C++) or the garbage collector drops them (Java, Rust with ownership).
  * Example:

    ```c
    void foo() {
        int* x = malloc(sizeof(int)); // stored on heap
        *x = 10;
        // x survives after foo() returns, unless freed
    }
    ```

So “storage outside of function calls” = the heap allows data to **outlive the scope** where it was created.

---

✅ **Quick Analogy**:

* **Stack** = your desk: things you’re working on right now, neatly stacked, removed when done.
* **Heap** = the filing cabinet: you put stuff there if you need it to stay around after you leave your desk. But finding/retrieving is slower, and things aren’t guaranteed to be next to each other.

---

👉 Do you want me to also show **Rust examples** of stack vs heap (with ownership & references) so you see how this plays out in real code?

Perfect 👌 you’re touching the **system allocator** and Rust’s **Allocator API** — this is exactly how Rust lets you control heap memory under the hood. Let me break it down in a way you could explain to students (and also show you real code examples).

---

## 🔹 How Heap Allocation Works in Rust

When you write something like:

```rust
let x = Box::new(42);
```

* `42` is stored on the **heap** (because `Box` allocates).
* By default, Rust uses the **system allocator** (`malloc`/`free` on Linux, `HeapAlloc`/`HeapFree` on Windows).
* But you can **swap it out** with your own allocator.

---

## 🔹 The System Allocator

Rust provides a crate for this:

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
```

```rust
use std::alloc::System;

#[global_allocator]
static GLOBAL: System = System;

fn main() {
    let v = Box::new(123);
    println!("Value = {}", v);
}
```

Here we explicitly tell Rust to use the system allocator. (Actually, most platforms do this by default.)

---

## 🔹 Custom Allocators

Rust lets you define your own allocator using the **`Allocator` trait** (`std::alloc`).

A super minimal example (not production-safe, just to illustrate):

```rust
use std::alloc::{GlobalAlloc, Layout};
use std::ptr::null_mut;

struct MyAllocator;

unsafe impl GlobalAlloc for MyAllocator {
    unsafe fn alloc(&self, layout: Layout) -> *mut u8 {
        println!("Allocating {} bytes", layout.size());
        std::alloc::System.alloc(layout) // delegate to system allocator
    }

    unsafe fn dealloc(&self, ptr: *mut u8, layout: Layout) {
        println!("Deallocating {} bytes", layout.size());
        std::alloc::System.dealloc(ptr, layout) // delegate
    }
}

#[global_allocator]
static A: MyAllocator = MyAllocator;

fn main() {
    let x = Box::new(99);
    println!("x = {}", x);
}
```

👉 Now whenever you allocate/deallocate (via `Box`, `Vec`, etc.), it prints messages showing allocations. This is how you could implement a **custom allocator** for logging, tracking memory, or even using a **fixed memory pool** instead of the OS heap.

---

## 🔹 Real Use Cases

* **Embedded systems**: Sometimes you don’t have `malloc`; you must provide your own fixed allocator.
* **Game engines / HPC**: Often use arenas, pools, or bump allocators for speed and cache efficiency.
* **Debugging**: Replace allocator to track leaks or visualize memory usage.

---

✅ **So in class you could say:**

* By default, Rust uses the **system allocator** for the heap.
* You can **plug in your own allocator** with the `Allocator API`.
* This allows advanced control: logging, memory pools, arenas, or performance tuning.

---

Would you like me to also show you a **Rust example of a simple bump allocator** (a classic teaching demo for students to see how custom allocators really work)?

Great question 🙌 — let’s go step by step because **Rust actually has *two levels* of allocator APIs**:

---

# 🔹 1. The *Low-level* Allocator API (`GlobalAlloc`)

This is the **unsafe, low-level API** for plugging in a global allocator.

* Trait: [`std::alloc::GlobalAlloc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/alloc/trait.GlobalAlloc.html)
* Methods you must implement:

  * `alloc(&self, layout: Layout) -> *mut u8` → allocate raw memory
  * `dealloc(&self, ptr: *mut u8, layout: Layout)` → free memory
  * (Optional) `realloc` and `alloc_zeroed`

Example:

```rust
use std::alloc::{GlobalAlloc, Layout, System};

struct MyAllocator;

unsafe impl GlobalAlloc for MyAllocator {
    unsafe fn alloc(&self, layout: Layout) -> *mut u8 {
        println!("Alloc {} bytes", layout.size());
        System.alloc(layout) // delegate to system allocator
    }
    unsafe fn dealloc(&self, ptr: *mut u8, layout: Layout) {
        println!("Free {} bytes", layout.size());
        System.dealloc(ptr, layout)
    }
}

#[global_allocator]
static A: MyAllocator = MyAllocator;

fn main() {
    let x = Box::new(10);
    println!("x = {}", x);
}
```

👉 This is the API you use if you want to replace the **global allocator** for your whole program.

---

# 🔹 2. The *High-level* Allocator API (`Allocator` trait)

Introduced more recently (stable since Rust 1.70), this is a **safe, generic API** for data structures that want to use **custom allocators** *per instance* (not globally).

* Trait: [`std::alloc::Allocator`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/alloc/trait.Allocator.html)
* Methods:

  * `allocate(&self, layout: Layout) -> Result<NonNull<[u8]>, AllocError>`
  * `deallocate(&self, ptr: NonNull<u8>, layout: Layout)`
  * Plus optional grow/shrink variants

---

### Example: `Vec` with a custom allocator

```rust
use std::alloc::{Allocator, Global};
use std::vec::Vec;

fn main() {
    let mut v: Vec<i32, Global> = Vec::new_in(Global); // uses the global allocator
    v.push(1);
    v.push(2);
    println!("{:?}", v);
}
```

You could swap `Global` with a custom allocator implementing `Allocator`.

---

# 🔹 Summary (easy to tell students)

* **`GlobalAlloc`** → low-level, unsafe API for defining the *one global allocator*.
* **`Allocator` trait** → modern, safe API that lets collections (`Vec`, `Box`, `String`, etc.) use **custom allocators** on a per-instance basis.

✅ So you can either:

* Replace the **whole program’s allocator** (with `#[global_allocator]` + `GlobalAlloc`), or
* Use the **Allocator API** to build containers that use custom memory pools, arenas, or tracking systems.

---

👉 Do you want me to show you a **teaching demo** where we build a `Vec` backed by a **custom bump allocator** (super simple, only moves a pointer forward)? That’s usually the most intuitive way students "get" the Allocator API.
