# ⚖️ Rust OOP vs Python OOP

| Concept                  | Python (Class-based OOP)                                                                       | Rust (Trait-based OOP)                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Class Definition**     | Uses `class` keyword, defines both data (attributes) and behavior (methods) together.          | Uses `struct` for data and `impl` for methods separately.                                                                             |
| **Encapsulation**        | Attributes can be public, private (by convention `_var`), or property-controlled.              | Fields are private by default. Visibility controlled with `pub`, `pub(crate)`, `pub(super)`, etc.                                     |
| **Abstraction**          | Achieved via abstract base classes (`abc` module) or duck typing.                              | Achieved via **traits**, which define shared behavior (like interfaces).                                                              |
| **Polymorphism**         | Very flexible — any object can be passed as long as it has the required methods (duck typing). | Strict — requires explicit trait implementation. Polymorphism through generics (`impl Trait`) or trait objects (`&dyn Trait`).        |
| **Inheritance**          | Supports single and multiple inheritance. Can override methods and extend classes.             | No inheritance for structs. Only **trait inheritance** (traits can extend other traits). Encourages **composition over inheritance**. |
| **Code Reuse**           | Inheritance + mixins.                                                                          | Traits + generics + composition.                                                                                                      |
| **Dynamic vs Static**    | Dynamic typing (types checked at runtime).                                                     | Static typing (types checked at compile time, ensures memory safety & no nulls).                                                      |
| **Method Binding**       | Methods defined inside class with `self`. Dynamic dispatch by default.                         | Methods defined in `impl`. Dispatch can be **static (generics)** or **dynamic (`dyn Trait`)**.                                        |
| **Memory Model**         | Objects live on the heap, garbage collected.                                                   | Objects may live on stack or heap, memory is managed via ownership + borrowing (no GC).                                               |
| **Constructors**         | `__init__` method.                                                                             | `fn new() -> Self` convention in `impl`.                                                                                              |
| **Magic/Dunder Methods** | `__str__`, `__add__`, etc.                                                                     | Operator traits (`Add`, `Display`, etc.) implementable for structs.                                                                   |

# 🐍 Python Example (Classic OOP)

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Vehicle(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def drive(self):
        pass

class Car(Vehicle):
    def __init__(self, brand, year):
        self.brand = brand
        self.year = year

    def drive(self):
        print(f"{self.brand} ({self.year}) is driving!")

class Bike(Vehicle):
    def __init__(self, brand, gears):
        self.brand = brand
        self.gears = gears

    def drive(self):
        print(f"{self.brand} bike with {self.gears} gears is pedaling!")

def start_journey(v: Vehicle):
    v.drive()

car = Car("Toyota", 2018)
bike = Bike("Giant", 21)

start_journey(car)
start_journey(bike)
```

# 🦀 Rust Example (OOP style)

```rust
trait Vehicle {
    fn drive(&self);
}

struct Car {
    brand: String,
    year: u16,
}

struct Bike {
    brand: String,
    gears: u8,
}

impl Vehicle for Car {
    fn drive(&self) {
        println!("{} ({}) is driving!", self.brand, self.year);
    }
}

impl Vehicle for Bike {
    fn drive(&self) {
        println!("{} bike with {} gears is pedaling!", self.brand, self.gears);
    }
}

fn start_journey(v: &dyn Vehicle) {
    v.drive();
}

fn main() {
    let car = Car { brand: "Toyota".to_string(), year: 2018 };
    let bike = Bike { brand: "Giant".to_string(), gears: 21 };

    start_journey(&car);
    start_journey(&bike);
}
```

# ✅ Summary

* **Python OOP**:

  * Very flexible.
  * Multiple inheritance, duck typing.
  * Runtime errors possible (method missing).
  * Simpler, but less safe.

* **Rust OOP**:

  * Strict and safe.
  * No inheritance for data, only for behavior (traits).
  * Compile-time checks ensure safety and performance.
  * Composition > inheritance.

👉 Think of it like this:

* Python = “freedom, dynamic, easy, but can shoot yourself in the foot.”
* Rust = “strict teacher, compile-time rules, but ensures your program is memory-safe and bug-resistant.”

---

Would you like me to also show you **how “inheritance” in Python maps to “trait extension + composition” in Rust** with a concrete example?

Perfect 👍 You’re asking a deep and important question. Let’s tackle it step by step:

Rust is **not a classic OOP language**, but it gives you *most* of the OOP advantages through **structs + impl + traits + modules**. What it doesn’t give you is **inheritance-based hierarchy** (like in Java/C++). Instead, it pushes you towards **composition + traits**, which is usually safer and more flexible.

---

## 🌟 Example: OOP-style in Rust

Let’s model vehicles (like we’d do in Java with a base `Vehicle` class and subclasses `Car`, `Bike`).

### 1. Define traits (like abstract base classes / interfaces)

```rust
trait Vehicle {
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
    fn wheels(&self) -> u8;
    fn drive(&self);
}
```

---

### 2. Define structs (like classes with fields)

```rust
struct Car {
    brand: String,
    year: u16,
}

struct Bike {
    brand: String,
    gear_count: u8,
}
```

---

### 3. Implement methods for each struct

```rust
impl Car {
    fn new(brand: &str, year: u16) -> Self {
        Self { brand: brand.to_string(), year }
    }
}

impl Bike {
    fn new(brand: &str, gear_count: u8) -> Self {
        Self { brand: brand.to_string(), gear_count }
    }
}
```

---

### 4. Implement the trait for polymorphism

```rust
impl Vehicle for Car {
    fn name(&self) -> &str { &self.brand }
    fn wheels(&self) -> u8 { 4 }
    fn drive(&self) {
        println!("{} (year {}) is driving with {} wheels!", self.brand, self.year, self.wheels());
    }
}

impl Vehicle for Bike {
    fn name(&self) -> &str { &self.brand }
    fn wheels(&self) -> u8 { 2 }
    fn drive(&self) {
        println!("{} bike is pedaling with {} wheels!", self.brand, self.wheels());
    }
}
```

---

### 5. Use polymorphism (dynamic dispatch)

```rust
fn start_journey(v: &dyn Vehicle) {
    v.drive();
}

fn main() {
    let car = Car::new("Toyota", 2018);
    let bike = Bike::new("Giant", 21);

    start_journey(&car);
    start_journey(&bike);
}
```

---

## ✅ OOP Advantages in Rust

* **Encapsulation** → Yes (`pub`, `mod`, private fields).
* **Abstraction** → Yes (traits).
* **Polymorphism** → Yes (trait objects `&dyn Trait` or generics `impl Trait`).
* **Code reuse** → Yes, via composition + trait bounds (but **no classical inheritance**).
* **Inheritance** → ❌ No (by design). Instead, Rust promotes **composition** and **trait extension** (traits can inherit from other traits).

Example of trait inheritance:

```rust
trait Vehicle {
    fn drive(&self);
}

trait Electric: Vehicle {
    fn charge(&self);
}
```

---

### 🌟 Key Insight

Rust deliberately **removes class inheritance** because it often causes brittle hierarchies and runtime issues (diamond problem, fragile base class problem). Instead, it uses **traits + composition**, which is *more flexible and safer*.

---

👉 Do you want me to also compare **Rust OOP vs Java OOP side-by-side**, so you can clearly see how every OOP concept translates?

Great question 🙂

Rust **does not have classes** like Java, C++, or Python — but it *does* provide a way to achieve the same ideas (encapsulation, methods, polymorphism, inheritance-like behavior).

Here’s how it maps:

---

### 🚀 1. **Structs instead of Classes**

In Rust, you use a `struct` to define data (like class fields).

```rust
struct Car {
    brand: String,
    year: u16,
}
```

---

### 🚀 2. **`impl` Blocks for Methods**

You add methods (like class member functions) using `impl`.

```rust
impl Car {
    fn new(brand: String, year: u16) -> Self {
        Self { brand, year }
    }

    fn age(&self) -> u16 {
        2025 - self.year
    }
}
```

Usage:

```rust
fn main() {
    let my_car = Car::new("Toyota".to_string(), 2015);
    println!("Car age: {}", my_car.age());
}
```

---

### 🚀 3. **Traits instead of Interfaces / Abstract Classes**

Traits define shared behavior (like interfaces in Java, or pure virtual classes in C++).

```rust
trait Drive {
    fn drive(&self);
}

impl Drive for Car {
    fn drive(&self) {
        println!("{} is driving!", self.brand);
    }
}
```

---

### 🚀 4. **Polymorphism with Traits**

Rust doesn’t have **class inheritance**, but it has **trait-based polymorphism**.
You can write functions that accept *any type that implements a trait*.

```rust
fn start_journey(vehicle: &impl Drive) {
    vehicle.drive();
}
```

---

### 🚀 5. **Encapsulation**

Rust doesn’t have `private` or `protected` inside structs, but visibility is controlled with **modules** (`pub`, `pub(crate)`, etc.).

```rust
pub struct Car {
    pub brand: String,   // visible outside module
    year: u16,           // private
}
```

---

### ✅ So, in summary:

* **Structs = class fields**
* **Impl = class methods**
* **Traits = interfaces/abstract classes**
* **No inheritance → composition + traits instead**

This makes Rust more like **composition-first OOP** with a **functional twist**.

---

👉 Do you want me to show you a **full OOP-like example in Rust** (with multiple structs, traits, and polymorphism), so it feels like a class hierarchy in Java/C++?

Perfect 👌 Let’s directly map **Python-style inheritance** to **Rust-style trait extension + composition**.

---

# 🐍 Python — Inheritance Example

Here’s a classic Python hierarchy:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Vehicle(ABC):   # base abstract class
    @abstractmethod
    def drive(self):
        pass

class ElectricVehicle(Vehicle):   # inherits from Vehicle
    @abstractmethod
    def charge(self):
        pass

class Tesla(ElectricVehicle):     # inherits from ElectricVehicle
    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model

    def drive(self):
        print(f"Tesla {self.model} is driving silently...")

    def charge(self):
        print(f"Tesla {self.model} is charging at the supercharger.")
```

Usage:

```python
car = Tesla("Model S")
car.drive()
car.charge()
```

✅ Here, **Tesla inherits behavior** from both `Vehicle` and `ElectricVehicle`.

---

# 🦀 Rust — Trait Extension + Composition

Rust doesn’t allow `struct Tesla: ElectricVehicle`, but it achieves the same through **trait extension**.

```rust
trait Vehicle {
    fn drive(&self);
}

// Trait that "inherits" from Vehicle
trait ElectricVehicle: Vehicle {
    fn charge(&self);
}

// Concrete struct
struct Tesla {
    model: String,
}

// Implement Vehicle for Tesla
impl Vehicle for Tesla {
    fn drive(&self) {
        println!("Tesla {} is driving silently...", self.model);
    }
}

// Implement ElectricVehicle for Tesla
impl ElectricVehicle for Tesla {
    fn charge(&self) {
        println!("Tesla {} is charging at the supercharger.", self.model);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let car = Tesla { model: "Model S".to_string() };

    car.drive();   // from Vehicle
    car.charge();  // from ElectricVehicle
}
```

---

# 🔑 Key Mapping

* Python **class inheritance** ⟶ Rust **trait extension**
* Python **abstract base class** ⟶ Rust **trait with unimplemented methods**
* Python **subclassing with multiple inheritance** ⟶ Rust **implementing multiple traits**
* Python **mixins** ⟶ Rust **traits with default methods**

---

# ✅ Summary

* In Python: **Inheritance is about reusing + specializing classes.**
* In Rust: **Composition (structs contain fields) + Traits (define shared behavior).**

Rust avoids the pitfalls of inheritance (diamond problem, fragile base classes), but still lets you build hierarchies of behavior through **traits extending other traits**.

---

⚡ Now here’s a thought: would you like me to **build a deeper hierarchy** (like `Vehicle -> ElectricVehicle -> SelfDrivingCar`) in **both Python and Rust**, so you can clearly see how far trait extension can mimic inheritance?
