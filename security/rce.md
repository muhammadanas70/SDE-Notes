Great question üëÄ ‚Äî let‚Äôs break it down clearly.

**RCE (Remote Code Execution)** happens when an attacker is able to run arbitrary code on a remote system (server, app, device) without having direct access. Basically, they trick the target into running malicious commands.

Here‚Äôs **how it usually happens step by step**:

---

### üîë Root Causes of RCE

1. **Unsanitized Input**

   * The application directly uses user input in code execution functions.
   * Example:

     ```python
     os.system("ping " + user_input)  
     ```

     If `user_input = "127.0.0.1; rm -rf /"`, then both ping and delete commands run.

2. **Deserialization Vulnerabilities**

   * Unsafe deserialization of objects can let attackers inject malicious serialized payloads that get executed when loaded.
   * Example: Java/PHP unserialize() bugs.

3. **Injection Attacks**

   * SQL Injection ‚Üí leads to OS command execution if database has functions like `xp_cmdshell` (MSSQL).
   * Template Injection (SSTI in Jinja2, Twig, etc.) ‚Üí attacker injects `{{config.__class__.__init__.__globals__['os'].system('id')}}`.

4. **File Upload Exploits**

   * Uploading a `.php`, `.jsp`, `.aspx` shell disguised as an image or doc.
   * When server processes the file incorrectly, attacker executes code.

5. **Unsafe APIs / Functions**

   * Languages like PHP (`eval`, `system`, `exec`) and Python (`eval`, `pickle.load`) are dangerous if exposed to user input.

6. **Dependency Vulnerabilities**

   * Using a vulnerable library/package that itself allows RCE.
   * Example: Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228) ‚Äî user-controlled input in logs led to RCE via JNDI lookups.

---

### ‚ö° Common RCE Flow

1. Attacker finds **entry point** (input not validated properly).
2. They send **payload** (malicious string/file/object).
3. Application **executes code unintentionally**.
4. Attacker gains **remote shell** or executes arbitrary commands.
5. Often they escalate privileges ‚Üí full system takeover.

---

### üîç Real-world Example

**PHP Web App**

```php
<?php
  $cmd = $_GET['cmd'];
  system($cmd);
?>
```

* User opens `http://victim.com/vuln.php?cmd=ls` ‚Üí executes `ls`.
* Then: `http://victim.com/vuln.php?cmd=cat+/etc/passwd`.

---

### üõ° How to Prevent

* Never directly execute user input.
* Use parameterized queries (SQL).
* Avoid dangerous functions (`eval`, `exec`).
* Validate & sanitize inputs.
* Use allowlists, not blocklists.
* Run apps with least privileges (so even if RCE happens, damage is limited).
* Keep dependencies updated.

---

üëâ Do you want me to also **show you how attackers build RCE payloads step-by-step (like an exploit chain)**, or just stick to **understanding and preventing** it?
Nice ‚Äî I‚Äôll go deep but keep this **safe and ethical**. I won‚Äôt provide exploit payloads or step-by-step exploit chains, but I will give you **practical, in-depth knowledge** you can use to *find* RCEs legally (bug bounties / labs) and to write strong reports that increase payability. Ready? Let‚Äôs go.

# What RCE actually means (short)

**Remote Code Execution (RCE)** means attacker-controlled input causes the target system to *execute attacker-specified code or commands*. Impact ranges from running a single command to full system takeover. Understanding *how* data flows from input ‚Üí logic ‚Üí execution is key.

# Common RCE vulnerability classes (what to look for, how to identify, and safe test ideas)

Below each class: **what it is**, **how to spot it**, **safe (non-destructive) testing approach**, and **how devs should fix it**.

### 1. Command Injection / OS command execution

* What: App builds OS commands using attacker-controllable strings and executes them.
* How to spot: code or endpoints that call system-level functions (`system()`, `exec()`, `Runtime.exec`, etc.), utilities that accept user input (ping/traceroute/convert), or file processing that shells out.
* Safe testing: within scope, probe with innocuous inputs and watch for unexpected behavior or different responses. Prefer *out-of-band* (OOB) detection (server makes an outbound request to a domain you control) when allowed by program rules.
* Fix: avoid composing shell strings; use safe APIs that pass arguments as arrays, validate/whitelist inputs, run processes with least privileges.

### 2. Unsafe eval / template injection (SSTI / expression language injection)

* What: User input is injected into an interpreter or template engine that supports expressions ‚Äî attacker can cause execution of host language or access internals.
* How to spot: template rendering endpoints that accept user templates or variables; endpoints returning eval'd content or using template engines with user-supplied fragments.
* Safe testing: look for unusual error messages, stack traces, or template-related debug output. Use test cases that cause predictable, harmless changes rather than running commands.
* Fix: never evaluate user templates; escape/encode user input; use template engines in sandboxed mode or with restricted functionality and strict whitelists.

### 3. Insecure deserialization

* What: Untrusted serialized data is deserialized into objects, potentially invoking dangerous constructors or gadget chains.
* How to spot: endpoints that accept serialized formats other than safe JSON (pickles, Java serialization, PHP `serialize`, YAML with full loader).
* Safe testing: prefer code review or test in staging. If authorized, send innocuous serialized payloads and observe behavior (errors, crashes).
* Fix: avoid binary/object deserialization of untrusted input; use simple formats (JSON), whitelist allowed types, use deserializers with safe modes.

### 4. File upload ‚Üí write + execution (web shell upload)

* What: attacker uploads a file that the server can later execute (e.g., uploads `.php` to a webroot).
* How to spot: file upload endpoints; misconfigured webserver serving upload directory as executable; image processors that execute code in uploaded files.
* Safe testing: check content-type handling and response behavior with benign files; never upload actual web shells on targets you don‚Äôt own. Use labs to practice.
* Fix: store uploads outside webroot, rename files, validate file types with allowlists, verify file contents, set restrictive permissions, and serve via a static file server that cannot execute.

### 5. Dependency vulnerabilities / unsafe libraries

* What: third-party packages that contain RCE (example class: remote lookups in logging libraries).
* How to spot: outdated dependencies, known CVEs in dependency tree.
* Safe testing: run dependency scanners on code you‚Äôre authorized to test or on your projects. For targets, mention observed outdated libraries in the report.
* Fix: patch/update, use SBOMs and automated dependency scanners.

### 6. Server-side request forgery (SSRF) leading to RCE

* What: SSRF lets an attacker make the server talk to internal services (metadata APIs, internal admin endpoints) which can then be abused to gain credentials or code execution.
* How to spot: endpoints that fetch URLs provided by users.
* Safe testing: only test SSRF where permitted; use OOB channels under authorization to detect blind SSRF.
* Fix: strict URL whitelists, resolve to IP allowlists, block private IP ranges, restrict metadata access, egress filtering.

### 7. CI/CD & build pipeline misconfigurations

* What: Build servers pulling artifacts, or overly-trusting webhooks, can be abused to inject code into production.
* How to spot: publicly writable artifact endpoints, weak auth on webhooks.
* Fix: secure CI credentials, validate artifacts, restrict who can push builds.

# Recon & discovery methodology (ethical / effective)

1. **Scope**: Always confirm what is in-scope. If it‚Äôs not explicitly allowed ‚Äî stop.
2. **Map the application**: endpoints, parameters, content types (form, JSON, file), subdomains, admin panels.
3. **Enumerate input vectors**: all params, headers, cookies, file uploads, JSON fields, query strings, Accept headers, host headers.
4. **Source code / public repos**: if the target publishes code, search for risky calls (`eval`, `system`, `Runtime.exec`, `pickle.loads`, `yaml.load`, `deserialize`, template APIs, use of `os`/`subprocess`). (This is powerful and legitimate for bug hunting.)
5. **Use passive and non-destructive dynamic tests**: fuzz for differences in error messages, unusual server responses, or time differences. Prefer staged/test environments and OOB detection methods when allowed.
6. **Record everything**: HTTP logs, timestamps, headers, server responses.

Tools you should learn (names only; practice on labs): Burp Suite (Proxy/Intruder/Scanner), OWASP ZAP, static analyzers (Bandit, Semgrep), dependency scanners (Snyk, GitHub Dependabot), code search (ripgrep), OOB services for detection (Burp Collaborator style in authorized tests), fuzzers and scanners in lab environments.

# How to build a **safe, non-destructive** PoC for bug bounties (what makes a report successful)

* **Title**: concise (endpoint + vulnerability type).
* **Impact summary**: clear statement of what an attacker could do and potential impact (RCE ‚Üí remote shell, privilege escalation, data exfil).
* **Scope & targets**: exact in-scope URL(s), parameter names, timestamp.
* **Reproduction steps (high-level, non-exploitative)**: describe the request you made (method, endpoint, parameter) and the server response (error messages, stack trace, or behavior). Avoid including active exploit strings if the program forbids exploit PoCs.
* **Observed evidence**: sanitized logs, screenshots, HTTP request/response (with secrets removed), and any OOB interaction identifiers if used legally.
* **Severity reasoning**: why this is critical (e.g., allows arbitrary code execution, leads to server takeover), and suggested CVSS score or triage guidance.
* **Suggested fix**: concrete developer-level remediation (code paths to change, validation guidance, example safe code patterns).
* **Regression test**: how they can validate the fix.
* **Add references**: OWASP, CVE examples (for context).

Good reports emphasize *impact and reproducibility*, not just ‚ÄúI can run commands.‚Äù A clear fix suggestion increases payability.

# Hardening & developer fixes (practical checklist)

* Use allowlists for all user-controlled inputs; validate and canonicalize inputs.
* Avoid `eval`/`exec`/`system` with raw user input; if you must run processes, pass arguments as arrays and avoid shells.
* Use safe deserialization libraries or avoid deserializing arbitrary objects (prefer JSON).
* Template engines: disable dangerous features, sandbox, and escape user data.
* File uploads: store outside webroot, strip metadata, validate content, set `noexec` on upload mounts.
* Principle of least privilege: run web processes with minimal rights; separate services.
* Network controls: egress filtering to limit outbound connections.
* Keep dependencies patched, maintain SBOM, and use dependency scanning.
* Monitor and alert: detect process spawns, unusual outbound connections, or integrity changes.

# Detection & forensics (what defenders monitor)

* Unexpected child process spawn logs.
* Outbound DNS/HTTP requests to unknown domains.
* New files in webroot or unexpected cron entries.
* Unexpected service restarts.
* File system integrity checks (Tripwire-like).
* WAF alerts and signature hits.

# Learning path & practice safely

* **Web Security Academy (PortSwigger)** ‚Äî interactive labs for SSTI, command injection and more.
* **OWASP Top 10 + Proactive Controls** ‚Äî fundamentals and mitigations.
* **CTF / labs**: HackTheBox, TryHackMe, VulnHub for vulnerable VMs ‚Äî *use these to practice exploits, not real targets*.
* **Code review practice**: read open-source apps and search for risky calls (`exec`, `system`, `pickle`, `yaml.load`, `eval`, template rendering with unsanitized input).
* **Tools**: learn Burp Suite, Semgrep, and dependency scanners ‚Äî practice within authorized targets.

# Ethics, legality, and payout tips

* Only test **in-scope** targets and follow program rules. Unauthorized testing is illegal.
* For higher payouts: explain impact clearly, provide reproducible evidence, suggest remediation, and be responsive to vendor questions. Include severity justification and potential real-world impact scenarios (data exfiltration, takeover of customer instances, etc.).

If you want, I can now **(pick one)**:

1. Give a **checklist** you can use during a live engagement to look for RCE vectors (compact and printable).
2. Show a **template** for writing a high-quality, bug-bounty RCE report (fillable).
3. Walk through a **sanitized code snippet** and point out risky lines and fixes (you can paste code you‚Äôre allowed to share).
4. Recommend a structured learning plan (weeks + labs) to level up fast.

Tell me which of the four you want and I‚Äôll produce it right away (safely and focused).

Perfect ‚úÖ ‚Äî let‚Äôs do this with **safe demo code**. I‚Äôll show you **insecure (vulnerable)** vs **secure (fixed)** side by side in different common RCE scenarios. That way you‚Äôll see *why* RCE happens and *how to avoid it*.

# üîπ Example 1: Command Injection (Python)

### ‚ùå Vulnerable

```python
import os
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/ping")
def ping():
    ip = request.args.get("ip")  # user input
    # BAD: concatenates input directly into command
    os.system("ping -c 1 " + ip)
    return "Pinged!"
```

* Attacker calls:

  ```
  /ping?ip=127.0.0.1; cat /etc/passwd
  ```

  ‚Üí runs `ping` and also dumps system files.

### ‚úÖ Secure

```python
import subprocess
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/ping")
def ping():
    ip = request.args.get("ip")
    # Validate input (whitelist IPv4 format)
    if not ip.replace(".", "").isdigit():
        return "Invalid IP", 400
    
    # Use subprocess with args list (no shell)
    subprocess.run(["ping", "-c", "1", ip], check=True)
    return "Pinged safely!"
```

---

# üîπ Example 2: Template Injection (Python + Jinja2)

### ‚ùå Vulnerable

```python
from flask import Flask, request, render_template_string

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/hello")
def hello():
    name = request.args.get("name", "world")
    # BAD: directly rendering user input as a template
    return render_template_string("Hello " + name)
```

* Attacker calls:

  ```
  /hello?name={{7*7}}
  ```

  ‚Üí output: `Hello 49`
  (From here, they can escalate to RCE if Jinja internals exposed).

### ‚úÖ Secure

```python
from flask import Flask, request, render_template_string

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/hello")
def hello():
    name = request.args.get("name", "world")
    # Escape user input ‚Üí treat as plain text, not code
    return render_template_string("Hello {{ name }}", name=name)
```

---

# üîπ Example 3: File Upload ‚Üí Webshell (PHP)

### ‚ùå Vulnerable

```php
<?php
if (isset($_FILES['file'])) {
    move_uploaded_file($_FILES['file']['tmp_name'], "uploads/" . $_FILES['file']['name']);
    echo "File uploaded!";
}
?>
```

* Attacker uploads `evil.php`:

  ```php
  <?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
  ```

  ‚Üí then runs `/uploads/evil.php?cmd=ls`.

### ‚úÖ Secure

```php
<?php
$allowed_types = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png'];

if (isset($_FILES['file'])) {
    $file_type = mime_content_type($_FILES['file']['tmp_name']);
    
    if (!in_array($file_type, $allowed_types)) {
        die("Invalid file type!");
    }

    // Store outside webroot, rename file
    $new_name = uniqid() . ".jpg";
    move_uploaded_file($_FILES['file']['tmp_name'], "/var/uploads/" . $new_name);

    echo "File uploaded safely!";
}
?>
```

---

# üîπ Example 4: Insecure Deserialization (Python Pickle)

### ‚ùå Vulnerable

```python
import pickle
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/load", methods=["POST"])
def load():
    data = request.data
    # BAD: loads raw pickle from user
    obj = pickle.loads(data)
    return f"Loaded: {obj}"
```

* Pickle payload can execute arbitrary code on load.

### ‚úÖ Secure

```python
import json
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/load", methods=["POST"])
def load():
    data = request.data
    # Use safe format instead of pickle
    obj = json.loads(data)
    return f"Loaded safely: {obj}"
```

---

# üîπ Example 5: Unsafe `eval` (JavaScript)

### ‚ùå Vulnerable

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.get("/calc", (req, res) => {
    const expr = req.query.expr; // e.g., 2+2
    // BAD: evaluates raw user input
    res.send("Result: " + eval(expr));
});
```

* Attacker calls:
  `/calc?expr=require('fs').readFileSync('/etc/passwd').toString()`
  ‚Üí arbitrary file read.

### ‚úÖ Secure

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.get("/calc", (req, res) => {
    const expr = req.query.expr;
    // Whitelist only numbers and math operators
    if (!/^[0-9+\-*/() ]+$/.test(expr)) {
        return res.status(400).send("Invalid expression");
    }

    // Use a safe math parser (like 'mathjs')
    const math = require("mathjs");
    const result = math.evaluate(expr);
    res.send("Result: " + result);
});
```

---

üëâ These patterns repeat across languages:

* **‚ùå Vulnerable:** directly use untrusted input in dangerous functions (`eval`, `system`, `exec`, deserialization, templates).
* **‚úÖ Secure:** validate, whitelist, escape, or switch to safe APIs.

---

Do you want me to also make a **printable ‚ÄúRCE cheat sheet‚Äù** that lists:

* risky functions in Python, PHP, JS, Java, etc.
* their secure alternatives
* short code snippets like above?

That could serve you as a **quick reference in bug bounty hunting**.

Perfect üëå ‚Äî that‚Äôs the **best way to truly understand RCE**: look at how vulnerable code is written vs. how secure code should be written.
I‚Äôll show you examples in **Python, PHP, and JavaScript/Node.js** since these are common in bug bounty targets.

---

# üêç Python

### ‚ùå Vulnerable

```python
import os
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/ping")
def ping():
    ip = request.args.get("ip")  # attacker-controlled
    # BAD: directly concatenates input into a shell command
    os.system("ping -c 1 " + ip)  
    return "Ping sent"
```

If someone visits:

```
http://example.com/ping?ip=127.0.0.1;cat+/etc/passwd
```

The `cat /etc/passwd` command will run after ping.

---

### ‚úÖ Secure

```python
import subprocess
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/ping")
def ping():
    ip = request.args.get("ip")
    # Whitelist allowed characters (digits, dots)
    if not ip or not ip.replace(".", "").isdigit():
        return "Invalid IP", 400
    
    # SAFE: pass args as list, avoids shell
    result = subprocess.run(["ping", "-c", "1", ip], capture_output=True, text=True)
    return result.stdout
```

---

# üêò PHP

### ‚ùå Vulnerable

```php
<?php
// User provides filename to view
$filename = $_GET['file'];

// BAD: passes input to system
system("cat " . $filename);
```

If attacker calls:

```
http://example.com/view.php?file=/etc/passwd;ls
```

They can list files or worse.

---

### ‚úÖ Secure

```php
<?php
$filename = $_GET['file'] ?? '';

// Whitelist allowed files
$allowed_files = ["readme.txt", "notes.txt"];

if (!in_array($filename, $allowed_files)) {
    die("Invalid file");
}

// SAFE: no command execution, just file read
echo htmlspecialchars(file_get_contents($filename));
```

---

# ‚ö° Node.js (JavaScript)

### ‚ùå Vulnerable

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const { exec } = require("child_process");
const app = express();

app.get("/run", (req, res) => {
    const cmd = req.query.cmd;
    // BAD: attacker controls shell command
    exec(cmd, (error, stdout, stderr) => {
        res.send(stdout || stderr);
    });
});

app.listen(3000);
```

Visiting:

```
http://localhost:3000/run?cmd=ls
```

runs `ls`. An attacker could run **any command**.

---

### ‚úÖ Secure

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const { spawn } = require("child_process");
const app = express();

app.get("/ping", (req, res) => {
    const ip = req.query.ip;

    // Simple regex validation
    if (!/^[0-9.]+$/.test(ip)) {
        return res.status(400).send("Invalid IP");
    }

    // SAFE: use spawn with arguments, not shell
    const ping = spawn("ping", ["-c", "1", ip]);

    let output = "";
    ping.stdout.on("data", (data) => {
        output += data.toString();
    });

    ping.on("close", () => {
        res.send(output);
    });
});

app.listen(3000);
```

---

# üîë Takeaway

* **Never** concatenate user input into commands.
* Always use **safe APIs** (e.g., `subprocess.run([...])`, `spawn([...])`).
* Apply **input validation** and **whitelisting**.
* Use **least privileges** (app shouldn‚Äôt run as `root`).

---

üëâ Do you want me to also show **a vulnerable deserialization example vs. secure** (e.g., Python `pickle`, PHP `unserialize`), since those are another huge RCE vector in bug bounty?

Got it üî• ‚Äî let‚Äôs extend this to **Rust**.
Even though Rust is *memory safe by design*, you can still introduce **RCE vulnerabilities** if you‚Äôre careless with:

* Shell execution (`std::process::Command`)
* Deserialization (`serde`, `bincode`, `rmp-serde`, etc.)
* FFI (calling unsafe C code)
* Template engines (`tera`, `handlebars`)

Here are **‚ùå vulnerable vs ‚úÖ secure Rust examples**:

---

# üîπ Example 1: Command Injection (Rust)

### ‚ùå Vulnerable

```rust
use std::process::Command;
use std::env;

fn main() {
    // Simulate user input from CLI arg
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();
    let user_input = &args[1];

    // BAD: passing through shell with sh -c
    Command::new("sh")
        .arg("-c")
        .arg(format!("ping -c 1 {}", user_input)) // untrusted input
        .status()
        .expect("failed to execute process");
}
```

* If user runs:

  ```bash
  cargo run -- "127.0.0.1; rm -rf /"
  ```

  ‚Üí both `ping` and delete commands execute.

---

### ‚úÖ Secure

```rust
use std::process::Command;
use std::env;

fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();
    let user_input = &args[1];

    // Whitelist: allow only digits and dots (IPv4)
    if !user_input.chars().all(|c| c.is_digit(10) || c == '.') {
        eprintln!("Invalid IP");
        return;
    }

    // SAFE: no shell, pass args directly
    Command::new("ping")
        .arg("-c")
        .arg("1")
        .arg(user_input)
        .status()
        .expect("failed to execute process");
}
```

---

# üîπ Example 2: Unsafe Deserialization (Rust)

### ‚ùå Vulnerable

```rust
use serde::{Deserialize};
use bincode;

#[derive(Deserialize, Debug)]
struct User {
    username: String,
    is_admin: bool,
}

fn main() {
    let data = std::fs::read("input.bin").unwrap();

    // BAD: directly deserializing untrusted binary input
    let user: User = bincode::deserialize(&data).unwrap();
    println!("{:?}", user);
}
```

* Attacker can craft malicious `input.bin` to manipulate program state, bypassing logic (e.g., making themselves admin).

---

### ‚úÖ Secure

```rust
use serde::{Deserialize};
use serde_json; // safer format

#[derive(Deserialize, Debug)]
struct User {
    username: String,
    is_admin: bool,
}

fn main() {
    let data = std::fs::read_to_string("input.json").unwrap();

    // SAFE: use JSON instead of raw binary
    let user: User = serde_json::from_str(&data).unwrap();

    // Additional validation
    if user.username.len() > 20 {
        panic!("Invalid username length!");
    }

    println!("{:?}", user);
}
```

---

# üîπ Example 3: Unsafe `eval`-like behavior

Rust doesn‚Äôt have `eval` built-in (thankfully üôè),
but libraries like [`meval`](https://docs.rs/meval) or custom scripting engines can act like it.

### ‚ùå Vulnerable

```rust
fn main() {
    let expr = std::env::args().nth(1).unwrap();
    // BAD: evaluates raw user input
    let val = meval::eval_str(expr).unwrap();
    println!("Result = {}", val);
}
```

If attacker finds a bug in `meval` or tricks logic, this could become dangerous.

---

### ‚úÖ Secure

```rust
fn main() {
    let expr = std::env::args().nth(1).unwrap();

    // Whitelist: allow only digits and math operators
    if !expr.chars().all(|c| c.is_ascii_digit() || "+-*/() ".contains(c)) {
        eprintln!("Invalid expression");
        return;
    }

    let val = meval::eval_str(expr).unwrap();
    println!("Result = {}", val);
}
```

---

# üîπ Example 4: Template Injection (Tera Templates)

### ‚ùå Vulnerable

```rust
use tera::Tera;
use tera::Context;

fn main() {
    let mut tera = Tera::default();
    let user_input = "{{ 7 * 7 }}"; // imagine attacker controls this
    let mut context = Context::new();

    // BAD: rendering raw input as template
    let rendered = tera.render_str(user_input, &context).unwrap();
    println!("{}", rendered); // => "49"
}
```

---

### ‚úÖ Secure

```rust
use tera::Tera;
use tera::Context;

fn main() {
    let mut tera = Tera::default();
    let mut context = Context::new();
    let user_input = "normal text"; // attacker-controlled

    // SAFE: escape input, don't treat as template
    context.insert("name", &user_input);

    let rendered = tera.render_str("Hello {{ name | escape }}", &context).unwrap();
    println!("{}", rendered);
}
```

---

# üîë Takeaways for Rust

* **Vulnerable** when you:

  * Use `Command::new("sh").arg("-c")` (never do this).
  * Deserialize untrusted binary formats (`bincode`, `pickle` equivalents).
  * Treat untrusted input as template/script.
* **Secure** by:

  * Passing args directly to `Command` (no shell).
  * Using JSON/YAML with validation instead of binary deserialization.
  * Escaping user input in templates.
  * Adding allowlists for expected inputs.

---

üëâ Would you like me to now make a **Rust-focused RCE cheat sheet** (list of dangerous crates/functions + secure alternatives) so you can use it in bug bounty/code reviews?
