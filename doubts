call by value, call by reference

When learning and coding in Python, memory management and related concepts play a crucial role in writing efficient and bug-free programs. Here are the main memory-related topics you should focus on:

### 1. **Memory Allocation in Python**
   - **Stack vs. Heap Memory**: 
     - Stack stores function calls and local variables.
     - Heap stores objects and dynamically allocated memory.
   - **Reference Counting**: Python uses reference counting for memory management.
   - **Garbage Collection**: Python's automatic garbage collector frees memory when objects are no longer needed.

### 2. **Call by Value vs. Call by Reference**
   - **Call by Value (Immutable types like int, float, str, tuple)**: A copy of the value is passed to functions.
   - **Call by Reference (Mutable types like list, dict, set, objects)**: The reference to the original object is passed, so modifications affect the original.

### 3. **Mutable vs. Immutable Objects**
   - **Immutable**: `int`, `float`, `str`, `tuple`, `frozenset`
   - **Mutable**: `list`, `dict`, `set`, `bytearray`
   - Understanding this helps in avoiding unintended modifications to objects.

### 4. **Memory Optimization Techniques**
   - **Using Generators Instead of Lists**: `yield` helps in saving memory when processing large data.
   - **String Interning**: Python optimizes memory by storing short strings in a shared pool.
   - **Using `__slots__` in Classes**: Prevents automatic dictionary creation for object attributes, saving memory.

### 5. **Copying Objects in Python**
   - **Shallow Copy (`copy.copy()`)**: Creates a new object but references inner objects.
   - **Deep Copy (`copy.deepcopy()`)**: Recursively copies all objects.
   - **Assignment (`=`)**: Just copies the reference, not the actual object.

### 6. **Python Memory Profiling & Debugging**
   - **`sys.getsizeof(obj)`**: Check the memory size of an object.
   - **`gc` module**: Manual garbage collection control.
   - **`memory_profiler`**: Helps analyze memory usage in Python programs.

### 7. **Object Identity and Aliasing**
   - **`id(obj)`**: Check the memory address of an object.
   - **Aliasing**: When multiple variables reference the same object.

### 8. **Caching & Memoization**
   - **`functools.lru_cache`**: Cache function results to save recomputation.
   - **Django's `cache` Framework**: Store data in memory for faster access.
