## Introduction to Greedy Algorithms {#introduction}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum. They follow the principle of making the best choice available at each moment without reconsidering previous decisions.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Local Optimization**: Make the best choice at each step
- **Irrevocable Decisions**: Never reconsider previous choices
- **Efficiency**: Often have excellent time complexity
- **Not Always Optimal**: May not guarantee global optimum for all problems

### When Greedy Works:
1. **Greedy Choice Property**: A globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making locally optimal choices
2. **Optimal Substructure**: An optimal solution contains optimal solutions to subproblems

## Job Scheduling Problem Overview {#problem-overview}

Job scheduling involves arranging tasks or jobs to optimize certain criteria such as:
- Minimizing completion time
- Maximizing profit
- Meeting deadlines
- Minimizing waiting time

### Common Variants:
1. **Activity Selection Problem**: Select maximum number of non-overlapping activities
2. **Job Scheduling with Deadlines**: Maximize profit while meeting deadlines
3. **Shortest Job First**: Minimize average waiting time
4. **Fractional Knapsack**: Maximize value within weight constraints

## Activity Selection Problem {#activity-selection}

**Problem**: Given n activities with start and finish times, select the maximum number of activities that don't overlap.

### Algorithm:
1. Sort activities by finish time
2. Select first activity
3. For each subsequent activity, select if it starts after the previous selected activity ends

### Python Implementation:

```python
def activity_selection(activities):
    """
    Select maximum number of non-overlapping activities.
    
    Args:
        activities: List of tuples (start_time, end_time, activity_id)
    
    Returns:
        List of selected activities
    """
    if not activities:
        return []
    
    # Sort by finish time
    sorted_activities = sorted(activities, key=lambda x: x[1])
    
    selected = [sorted_activities[0]]
    last_finish_time = sorted_activities[0][1]
    
    for i in range(1, len(sorted_activities)):
        start_time, end_time, activity_id = sorted_activities[i]
        
        # If current activity starts after last selected ends
        if start_time >= last_finish_time:
            selected.append(sorted_activities[i])
            last_finish_time = end_time
    
    return selected

# Example usage
activities = [
    (1, 4, 'A1'),   # Activity A1: 1-4
    (3, 5, 'A2'),   # Activity A2: 3-5
    (0, 6, 'A3'),   # Activity A3: 0-6
    (5, 7, 'A4'),   # Activity A4: 5-7
    (3, 9, 'A5'),   # Activity A5: 3-9
    (5, 9, 'A6'),   # Activity A6: 5-9
    (6, 10, 'A7'),  # Activity A7: 6-10
    (8, 11, 'A8'),  # Activity A8: 8-11
    (8, 12, 'A9'),  # Activity A9: 8-12
    (2, 14, 'A10'), # Activity A10: 2-14
    (12, 16, 'A11') # Activity A11: 12-16
]

result = activity_selection(activities)
print("Selected activities:", result)
print(f"Total activities selected: {len(result)}")
```

### Rust Implementation:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
struct Activity {
    start: i32,
    end: i32,
    id: String,
}

impl Activity {
    fn new(start: i32, end: i32, id: &str) -> Self {
        Activity {
            start,
            end,
            id: id.to_string(),
        }
    }
}

fn activity_selection(mut activities: Vec<Activity>) -> Vec<Activity> {
    if activities.is_empty() {
        return Vec::new();
    }
    
    // Sort by finish time
    activities.sort_by(|a, b| a.end.cmp(&b.end));
    
    let mut selected = vec![activities[0].clone()];

            selected.push(activities[i].clone());
            last_finish_time = activities[i].end;
        }
    }
    
    selected
}

fn main() {
    let activities = vec![
        Activity::new(1, 4, "A1"),

        Activity::new(2, 14, "A10"),
        Activity::new(12, 16, "A11"),
    ];
    
    let result = activity_selection(activities);
    println!("Selected activities: {:?}", result);
    println!("Total activities selected: {}", result.len());

## Job Scheduling with Deadlines {#job-scheduling-deadlines}

**Problem**: Given n jobs with deadlines and profits, schedule jobs to maximize profit while meeting deadlines.

## Time Complexity Analysis {#complexity-analysis}

### Activity Selection Problem:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to sorting
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) additional space

### Job Scheduling with Deadlines:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n² + n log n)
  - O(n log n) for sorting
  - O(n²) for finding time slots
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for time slot array

### Fractional Knapsack:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to sorting
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) additional space

### Optimization Tips:
1. **Union-Find**: Can optimize job scheduling to O(n log n)
2. **Heap Data Structures**: Useful for priority-based scheduling
3. **Preprocessing**: Sort data once, reuse multiple times

## Real-World Applications {#applications}

### 1. CPU Scheduling
```python
def shortest_job_first(jobs):
    """Implement Shortest Job First scheduling algorithm."""
    jobs.sort(key=lambda x: x.burst_time)
    
    current_time = 0
    waiting_times = []
    
    for job in jobs:
        waiting_times.append(current_time)
        current_time += job.burst_time
    
    avg_waiting_time = sum(waiting_times) / len(waiting_times)
    return jobs, waiting_times, avg_waiting_time
```

### 2. Resource Allocation
```python
def resource_allocation(tasks, resources):
    """Allocate resources to tasks to maximize efficiency."""
    # Sort tasks by priority/efficiency ratio
    tasks.sort(key=lambda x: x.priority / x.resource_requirement, reverse=True)
    
    allocated_tasks = []
    remaining_resources = resources
    
    for task in tasks:
        if task.resource_requirement <= remaining_resources:
            allocated_tasks.append(task)
            remaining_resources -= task.resource_requirement
    
    return allocated_tasks
```

### 3. Meeting Room Scheduling
```python
def schedule_meetings(meetings):
    """Schedule maximum number of non-overlapping meetings."""
    return activity_selection(meetings)  # Reuse activity selection
```

### 4. Network Packet Scheduling
```python
def packet_scheduling(packets, bandwidth):
    """Schedule network packets based on priority and size."""
    packets.sort(key=lambda x: x.priority / x.size, reverse=True)
    
    scheduled = []
    used_bandwidth = 0
    
    for packet in packets:
        if used_bandwidth + packet.size <= bandwidth:
            scheduled.append(packet)
            used_bandwidth += packet.size
    
    return scheduled
```

Greedy algorithms provide efficient solutions for many scheduling problems. While they don't guarantee optimal solutions for all problems, they work exceptionally well for problems with greedy choice property and optimal substructure. The key to success lies in:

1. **Correct Problem Analysis**: Ensuring the problem is suitable for greedy approach
2. **Appropriate Sorting Strategy**: Choosing the right criteria for making greedy choices
3. **Efficient Implementation**: Using appropriate data structures and algorithms
4. **Thorough Testing**: Verifying correctness with various test cases

The implementations provided demonstrate both Python and Rust approaches, showcasing different programming paradigms while maintaining algorithmic efficiency. These patterns can be adapted to solve many real-world scheduling and optimization problems.

I'll create a detailed ASCII diagram showing how the Greedy Job Scheduling algorithm works step by step. This will demonstrate the classic "Activity Selection Problem" approach.I've created a comprehensive ASCII diagram showing how the Greedy Job Scheduling algorithm works step by step. The diagram illustrates:

1. **Problem Setup**: Shows 10 jobs with different start and end times
2. **Step 1**: Demonstrates sorting jobs by finish time (the key greedy choice)
3. **Step 2**: Goes through each iteration of the selection process, showing:
   - Which job is being considered
   - Whether it conflicts with previously selected jobs
   - The decision to select or reject
   - Visual timeline showing overlaps

4. **Final Result**: Shows the optimal schedule with 3 selected jobs

**Key Insights from the Diagram:**
- The algorithm makes locally optimal choices (earliest finish time) that lead to a globally optimal solution
- Jobs are rejected when their start time is before the end time of the last selected job
- The greedy strategy maximizes the number of jobs that can be scheduled without overlap

The algorithm achieves O(n log n) time complexity due to the initial sorting step, and the greedy approach guarantees an optimal solution for the job scheduling problem.

# Greedy Job Scheduling Algorithm - Step by Step

## Problem: Select maximum number of non-overlapping jobs

**Input Jobs with Start and End Times:**
```
Job A: [1, 4]    Job B: [3, 5]    Job C: [0, 6]    Job D: [5, 7]    Job E: [8, 9]
Job F: [5, 9]    Job G: [6, 10]   Job H: [8, 11]   Job I: [8, 12]   Job J: [2, 13]
```

## Step 1: Sort Jobs by Finish Time (Greedy Choice)
```
Time:  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13
       |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
Job A: [████████]                                    finish: 4
Job B:       [████████]                             finish: 5
Job C: [████████████████████████]                   finish: 6
Job D:                [████████]                    finish: 7
Job E:                            [████]            finish: 9
Job F:                [████████████████]            finish: 9
Job G:                   [████████████████]         finish: 10
Job H:                            [████████████]    finish: 11
Job I:                            [████████████████] finish: 12
Job J:    [████████████████████████████████████████] finish: 13

Sorted by finish time: A(4) → B(5) → C(6) → D(7) → E(9) → F(9) → G(10) → H(11) → I(12) → J(13)
```

## Algorithm Summary
```
GREEDY-JOB-SCHEDULING(jobs):
1. Sort jobs by finish time (earliest first)
2. Initialize: selected = [], lastEndTime = -∞
3. For each job in sorted order:
   - If job.start ≥ lastEndTime:
     * Add job to selected
     * Update lastEndTime = job.end
4. Return selected jobs

Time Complexity: O(n log n) - dominated by sorting
Space Complexity: O(1) - excluding output
```

## Why Greedy Works (Proof Sketch)
1. **Greedy Choice**: Always pick job that finishes earliest
2. **Optimal Substructure**: After picking a job, the remaining problem has the same structure
3. **Stay Ahead**: Greedy solution never falls behind optimal solution in terms of finish times
4. **Exchange Argument**: Can transform any optimal solution into greedy solution without losing optimality
