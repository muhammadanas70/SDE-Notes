## ‚ö° Handy Tricks

* **Stack**:

  * Use for problems with **reversal, undo, nested structure, "previous/next" element**.
  * **Monotonic stacks** = must-learn for range queries.

* **Queue**:

  * Use for **level-wise processing, FIFO order, streaming problems**.
  * **Deque** = optimized sliding window.

Do you want me to **add Disjoint Set (Union-Find) and Hashing patterns** too, so your cheat sheet covers *all core data structures*?

üî• Great ‚Äî **Dynamic Programming (DP)** is one of the most important problem-solving patterns.
It‚Äôs tricky at first, but nearly all DP problems fall into **recognizable patterns**.

Here‚Äôs a structured breakdown for your cheat sheet:

---

# üß© Dynamic Programming Problem-Solving Patterns

---

## 1. **Fibonacci / Linear DP (1D)**

* Transition depends on a few previous states.
* Common problems:

  * Fibonacci sequence.
  * Climbing stairs.
  * House robber (pick or skip).
  * Min cost climbing stairs.

üëâ Pattern: `dp[i] = f(dp[i-1], dp[i-2], ...)`

---

## 2. **Knapsack Patterns**

* **0/1 Knapsack**: pick or skip each item.
* **Unbounded Knapsack**: items can be chosen multiple times.
* Common problems:

  * Subset sum.
  * Partition equal subset sum.
  * Coin change (min coins or total ways).
  * Target sum.

üëâ Pattern: choose/don‚Äôt choose ‚Üí `dp[i][w]`

---

## 3. **Grid / Matrix DP**

* Move in a grid with constraints (right, down, etc.).
* Common problems:

  * Unique paths.
  * Minimum path sum.
  * Dungeon game.
  * Maximal square.

üëâ Pattern: `dp[i][j] = f(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`

---

## 4. **Longest Sequence DP**

* Build increasing, decreasing, or common subsequences.
* Common problems:

  * Longest increasing subsequence (LIS).
  * Longest common subsequence (LCS).
  * Longest palindromic subsequence.
  * Edit distance (Levenshtein).

üëâ Pattern: `dp[i][j] = f(dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`

---

## 5. **Interval DP**

* Solve problems on subarrays/substrings by splitting them.
* Common problems:

  * Matrix chain multiplication.
  * Burst balloons.
  * Palindrome partitioning.
  * Minimum score triangulation.

üëâ Pattern: `dp[l][r] = min/max over partition (dp[l][k] + dp[k+1][r])`

---

## 6. **Bitmask DP**

* State compression using bitmasks for subsets.
* Common problems:

  * Traveling salesman problem (TSP).
  * Minimum cost to connect cities.
  * Count ways to assign tasks.

üëâ Pattern: `dp[mask] = f(dp[mask without i])`

---

## 7. **DP on Trees / Graphs**

* DFS + memoization on nodes.
* Common problems:

  * Diameter of tree.
  * Maximum path sum.
  * Count independent sets.
  * Number of ways to color a tree.

üëâ Pattern: `dp[node] = combine(dp[children])`

## 8. **Game Theory DP (Minimax / Grundy numbers)**

* Turn-based games, each move affects opponent‚Äôs state.
* Common problems:

  * Stone game.
  * Nim game variations.
  * Predict the winner.

üëâ Pattern: `dp[state] = best move vs opponent`

---

## 9. **Digit DP**

* Counting numbers with digit constraints.
* Common problems:

  * Count numbers with certain digits.
  * Sum of digits in a range.
  * No consecutive ones in binary representation.

## 10. **Probability / Expectation DP**

* Expected value of games or outcomes.
* Common problems:

  * Random walks.
  * Expected steps in Markov process.

üëâ Pattern: `dp[state] = weighted sum of next states`

---

## 11. **Memory Optimization Tricks**

* Many DP problems only need the **previous row/column** ‚Üí reduce space.
* Rolling array: `dp[i % 2][...]`
* Example:

  * Fibonacci ‚Üí O(1) memory.
  * Unique paths ‚Üí O(n) memory.
