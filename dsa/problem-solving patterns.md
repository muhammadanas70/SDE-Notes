# Problem-Solving Patterns in Programming

I'll create a comprehensive catalog of problem-solving patterns used in programming and algorithms. This will serve as a reference guide covering patterns from basic to advanced levels.I've created a comprehensive catalog of problem-solving patterns that covers the fundamental algorithmic techniques used in programming, from basic to advanced levels. The catalog is organized into 12 major categories:

**Core Categories Covered:**

- Array & String patterns (Two Pointers, Sliding Window, etc.)
- Sorting & Searching techniques (Binary Search, Merge Sort, etc.)
- Tree & Graph algorithms (DFS, BFS, Union-Find)
- Dynamic Programming patterns (Linear, 2D, Knapsack, etc.)
- Backtracking approaches (Combinations, Permutations, Constraint Satisfaction)
- Greedy algorithms (Activity Selection, Huffman Coding)
- Advanced graph algorithms (Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall, etc.)
- String processing (KMP, Trie, etc.)
- Mathematical patterns (Sieve, Fast Exponentiation)
- Advanced data structures (Segment Tree, Monotonic Stack)
- Bit manipulation techniques (XOR, Bit Masking)
- Specialized algorithms (Reservoir Sampling, Boyer-Moore, etc.)

Each pattern includes:

- **Concept explanation** - what the pattern does
- **When to use** - problem indicators and use cases  
- **Time/Space complexity** - performance characteristics
- **Example problems** - real problems that use the pattern
- **Variants** - different implementations or extensions

The catalog also includes a **Pattern Selection Strategy** section to help you identify which pattern to apply to new problems, plus tips for mastering these techniques.

This serves as both a learning resource for understanding these patterns and a reference guide you can return to when tackling algorithmic problems. The key is recognizing that most programming problems are variations of these well-established patterns - once you master pattern recognition, problem-solving becomes much more systematic and efficient.

## Comprehensive Problem-Solving Patterns in Programming

A complete catalog of algorithmic patterns and problem-solving techniques from basic to advanced levels.

## 1. Array and String Patterns

### Two Pointers

**Concept**: Use two indices to traverse data structure, often from opposite ends or at different speeds.

**When to use**:

- Problems involving sorted arrays
- Searching for pairs or triplets
- Finding pairs in sorted arrays
- Palindrome checking
- Removing duplicates
- Container with most water problems
**Time Complexity**: Usually O(n)
**Example Problems**: Two Sum II, Valid Palindrome, Remove Duplicates

### Sliding Window

**Concept**: Maintain a window of elements and slide it across the array/string.
**When to use**:

- Subarray/substring problems with conditions
- Finding maximum/minimum in subarrays
- Problems involving consecutive elements
**Types**:
- Fixed size window
- Variable size window
**Time Complexity**: O(n)
**Example Problems**: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters, Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K

### Fast and Slow Pointers (Floyd's Cycle Detection)

**Concept**: Two pointers moving at different speeds to detect cycles or find middle elements.
**When to use**:

- Cycle detection in linked lists
- Finding middle of linked list
- Detecting patterns in sequences
**Time Complexity**: O(n)
**Example Problems**: Linked List Cycle, Happy Number, Find Middle of Linked List

Perfect follow-up! üöÄ
Detecting a **cycle in a linked list** is another **two pointer (Floyd‚Äôs Cycle Detection)** problem.

---

## üîë Concept (Floyd‚Äôs Tortoise & Hare Algorithm)

* Use **two pointers**:

  * `slow` ‚Üí moves **1 step at a time**
  * `fast` ‚Üí moves **2 steps at a time**

* If there is a **cycle**:

  * `fast` and `slow` will eventually **meet inside the cycle**.

* If there is **no cycle**:

  * `fast` (or `fast.next`) will reach `None` (end of list).

---

## üìñ Example

Linked List with a cycle:

```
1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 4
      ‚Üë     ‚Üì
      6 ‚Üê 5
```

Steps:

* Start: `slow = 1`, `fast = 1`
* Move: `slow = 2`, `fast = 3`
* Move: `slow = 3`, `fast = 5`
* Move: `slow = 4`, `fast = 3`
* Move: `slow = 5`, `fast = 5` ‚úÖ they meet ‚Üí cycle detected

---

## ‚ö° Python Implementation

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.next = None

def has_cycle(head):
    slow = fast = head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        if slow == fast:
            return True
    return False

# Example usage
head = Node(1)
head.next = Node(2)
head.next.next = Node(3)
head.next.next.next = Node(4)
head.next.next.next.next = head.next  # cycle at node 2

print("Cycle detected?", has_cycle(head))  # Output: True
```

---

## ‚ö° Rust Implementation

```rust
use std::rc::Rc;
use std::cell::RefCell;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Node {
    val: i32,
    next: Option<Rc<RefCell<Node>>>,
}

fn has_cycle(head: Option<Rc<RefCell<Node>>>) -> bool {
    let mut slow = head.clone();
    let mut fast = head.clone();

    while let (Some(s), Some(f)) = (slow.clone(), fast.clone()) {
        let f_next = f.borrow().next.clone();
        if f_next.is_none() {
            return false;
        }
        let f_next_next = f_next.unwrap().borrow().next.clone();

        slow = s.borrow().next.clone();
        fast = f_next_next;

        if slow.is_some() && fast.is_some() && Rc::ptr_eq(&slow.as_ref().unwrap(), &fast.as_ref().unwrap()) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    false
}
```

## ASCII Diagram (Cycle Detection)

```
1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 4
      ‚Üë     ‚Üì
      6 ‚Üê 5

slow = 1, fast = 1
slow = 2, fast = 3
slow = 3, fast = 5
slow = 4, fast = 3
slow = 5, fast = 5 ‚Üí they meet ‚Üí cycle exists ‚úÖ
```

---

üëâ Do you also want me to explain **how to find the starting node of the cycle** after detecting it?


Great question üöÄ This is a **classic linked list interview problem** and the **two pointer technique (slow & fast pointer)** is the cleanest way to solve it.

---

## üîë Concept

* Use **two pointers**:

  * `slow` ‚Üí moves **one step at a time**
  * `fast` ‚Üí moves **two steps at a time**

* When `fast` reaches the end of the list:

  * `slow` will be at the **middle**.

---

## üìñ Example Walkthrough

Linked List:

```
1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 5
```

Steps:

* Start: `slow = 1`, `fast = 1`
* Move: `slow = 2`, `fast = 3`
* Move: `slow = 3`, `fast = 5`
* `fast` can‚Äôt move further ‚Üí **middle = 3**

For even-length list:

```
1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 5 ‚Üí 6
```

* Start: `slow = 1`, `fast = 1`
* Move: `slow = 2`, `fast = 3`
* Move: `slow = 3`, `fast = 5`
* Move: `slow = 4`, `fast = null`
* **middle = 4** (we pick the 2nd middle in even length)

---

## ‚ö° Python Example

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.next = None

def find_middle(head):
    slow = fast = head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
    return slow.val

# Example
head = Node(1)
head.next = Node(2)
head.next.next = Node(3)
head.next.next.next = Node(4)
head.next.next.next.next = Node(5)

print("Middle:", find_middle(head))  # Output: 3
```

---

## ‚ö° Rust Example

```rust
use std::rc::Rc;
use std::cell::RefCell;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Node {
    val: i32,
    next: Option<Rc<RefCell<Node>>>,
}

fn find_middle(head: Option<Rc<RefCell<Node>>>) -> i32 {
    let mut slow = head.clone();
    let mut fast = head.clone();

    while fast.is_some() && fast.as_ref().unwrap().borrow().next.is_some() {
        slow = slow.unwrap().borrow().next.clone();
        fast = fast.unwrap().borrow().next.clone()
                     .unwrap().borrow().next.clone();
    }

    slow.unwrap().borrow().val
}

fn main() {
    // Build linked list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
    let node5 = Rc::new(RefCell::new(Node { val: 5, next: None }));
    let node4 = Rc::new(RefCell::new(Node { val: 4, next: Some(node5) }));
    let node3 = Rc::new(RefCell::new(Node { val: 3, next: Some(node4) }));
    let node2 = Rc::new(RefCell::new(Node { val: 2, next: Some(node3) }));
    let node1 = Rc::new(RefCell::new(Node { val: 1, next: Some(node2) }));

    println!("Middle: {}", find_middle(Some(node1))); // Output: 3
}
```

Step 1:

Step 2:

```

üëâ Do you want me to also show the **array-like simulation table** (step by step movement of slow & fast) for both even and odd linked lists?

Great question üéØ ‚Äî **Happy Number** is another place where the **two pointer cycle detection (Floyd‚Äôs algorithm)** shines.

---

## üîë Definition

A number is called a **Happy Number** if:

* Starting with the number, replace it by the **sum of the squares of its digits**.
* Repeat the process until:

  * It becomes `1` (‚úÖ Happy Number), or
  * It loops endlessly in a cycle that does **not include 1** (‚ùå Not Happy).

---

## üìñ Example

üëâ Check if `19` is a happy number:

```
19 ‚Üí 1¬≤ + 9¬≤ = 82
82 ‚Üí 8¬≤ + 2¬≤ = 68
68 ‚Üí 6¬≤ + 8¬≤ = 100
100 ‚Üí 1¬≤ + 0¬≤ + 0¬≤ = 1 ‚úÖ Happy Number
```

üëâ Check `4`:

```
4 ‚Üí 4¬≤ = 16
16 ‚Üí 1¬≤ + 6¬≤ = 37
37 ‚Üí 3¬≤ + 7¬≤ = 58
58 ‚Üí 5¬≤ + 8¬≤ = 89
89 ‚Üí 8¬≤ + 9¬≤ = 145
145 ‚Üí 1¬≤ + 4¬≤ + 5¬≤ = 42
42 ‚Üí 4¬≤ + 2¬≤ = 20
20 ‚Üí 2¬≤ + 0¬≤ = 4 (back to start) ‚ùå Cycle ‚Üí Not Happy
```

---

## ‚ö° Python Implementation

```python
def digit_square_sum(n):
    return sum(int(d)**2 for d in str(n))

def is_happy(n):
    slow = n
    fast = digit_square_sum(n)
    while fast != 1 and slow != fast:
        slow = digit_square_sum(slow)
        fast = digit_square_sum(digit_square_sum(fast))
    return fast == 1

# Example
print(is_happy(19))  # True
print(is_happy(4))   # False
```

---

## ‚ö° Rust Implementation

```rust
fn digit_square_sum(mut n: i32) -> i32 {
    let mut sum = 0;
    while n > 0 {
        let d = n % 10;
        sum += d * d;
        n /= 10;
    }
    sum
}

fn is_happy(mut n: i32) -> bool {
    let mut slow = n;
    let mut fast = digit_square_sum(n);

    while fast != 1 && slow != fast {
        slow = digit_square_sum(slow);
        fast = digit_square_sum(digit_square_sum(fast));
    }
    fast == 1
}

fn main() {
    println!("19 is happy? {}", is_happy(19)); // true
    println!("4 is happy? {}", is_happy(4));   // false
}
```

---

## ASCII Flow (Cycle Detection in Happy Numbers)

```
Number: 19

slow = 19, fast = 82
slow = 82, fast = 100
slow = 68, fast = 1 ‚Üí stop ‚úÖ Happy
```

---

üëâ Do you want me to also show a **step-by-step simulation table** (like I did for sliding window) for Happy Number detection? That way you can **visualize slow & fast movement** while checking happiness.


### Prefix Sum

**Concept**: Precompute cumulative sums to answer range sum queries efficiently.

The provided array and its prefix sums are correct. Let me verify and explain:

**Original array**: `arr = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`

**Prefix sums**: `prefix = [3, 4, 8, 9, 14]`

### Verification:

- The prefix sum at index `i` is the sum of all elements in `arr` from index `0` to `i`.
- Let's compute the prefix sums step-by-step:
  - `prefix[0] = arr[0] = 3`
  - `prefix[1] = arr[0] + arr[1] = 3 + 1 = 4`
  - `prefix[2] = arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2] = 3 + 1 + 4 = 8`
  - `prefix[3] = arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2] + arr[3] = 3 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 9`
  - `prefix[4] = arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2] + arr[3] + arr[4] = 3 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 5 = 14`

The computed prefix sums match the provided `prefix = [3, 4, 8, 9, 14]`.

### Explanation:

- Each element in the `prefix` array represents the cumulative sum of the elements in `arr` up to that index.
- For example, `prefix[2] = 8` is the sum of `arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2] = 3 + 1 + 4`.

If you have a specific question about the array or prefix sums (e.g., calculating a range sum, modifying the array, or visualizing the data), please let me know! For instance, I can generate a chart to visualize the original array or prefix sums if you'd like‚Äîjust confirm if that's what you want.

Let me explain Prefix Sum (cumulative sums) with examples:

Concept:

Calculate running sum of array elements from start to each position
Store these sums in prefix array
Use these precomputed sums for range queries
Example:

### Original array

arr =    [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]

### Prefix sums

prefix = [3, 4, 8, 9, 14]

How to build prefix array:

def build_prefix_sum(arr):
    prefix = [0] * len(arr)
    prefix[0] = arr[0]
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + arr[i]
    return prefix

Range Sum Query:

Sum of range [i,j] = prefix[j] - prefix[i-1]
For i=0: just use prefix[j]

def range_sum(prefix, left, right):
    if left == 0:
        return prefix[right]
    return prefix[right] - prefix[left-1]

### Example usage

arr = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]
prefix = build_prefix_sum(arr)

### Sum of range [1,3] (indices 1 to 3)

print(range_sum(prefix, 1, 3))  # Output: 6 (1+4+1)

Time Complexity:

Build prefix array: O(n)
Range sum query: O(1)
Space complexity: O(n)
This is much faster than computing range sums directly (which would be O(n) per query).
**When to use**:

- Frequent sum queries over subarrays
- Range sum queries
- Subarray sum problems
- 2D matrix sum queries
**Time Complexity**: O(1) for queries after O(n) preprocessing
**Example Problems**: Subarray Sum Equals K, Range Sum Query

## 2. Sorting and Searching Patterns

### Binary Search

**Concept**: Divide search space in half repeatedly to find target or condition.
**When to use**:

- Searching in sorted arrays
- Finding boundaries/thresholds
- Optimization problems with monotonic properties
**Variants**:
- Classic binary search
- Lower bound/upper bound
- Binary search on answer
**Time Complexity**: O(log n)
**Example Problems**: Search Insert Position, Find Peak Element, Sqrt(x)

### Merge Sort Pattern

**Concept**: Divide array into halves, sort recursively, then merge.
**When to use**:

- General-purpose sorting
- Stable sorting required
- Counting inversions
- External sorting
**Time Complexity**: O(n log n)
**Example Problems**: Sort Array, Count Inversions, Merge k Sorted Lists

### Quick Select

Quick Select is categorized as a **selection algorithm** in computer science, specifically used to find the **k-th smallest (or largest) element** in an unordered array. It falls under the broader category of **sorting and searching algorithms** and is closely related to the **QuickSort** algorithm, as it uses a similar partitioning strategy.

### Key Characteristics:

- **Category**: Selection algorithm / Order statistic algorithm
- **Purpose**: Finds the k-th smallest (or largest) element in an array without fully sorting it.
- **Time Complexity**: 

  - Average case: O(n)
  - Worst case: O(n¬≤)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) (in-place algorithm)
An in-place algorithm is one that transforms input using no extra space or only a small, constant extra space. The input is usually overwritten by the output as the algorithm executes.

Key characteristics:

Modifies input directly
Uses O(1) extra space
Original input is overwritten
Common examples:

## 1. Bubble Sort (in-place)

def bubble_sort(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        for j in range(len(arr)-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                # Swap in-place
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]

## 2. Quick Sort (in-place)

def quick_sort(arr, left, right):
    # Modifies array in-place through partitioning
    if left < right:
        pivot_index = partition(arr, left, right)
        quick_sort(arr, left, pivot_index - 1)
        quick_sort(arr, pivot_index + 1, right)
def partition(arr, left, right):
    pivot = arr[right]
    i = left - 1
    for j in range(left, right):
        if arr[j] < pivot:
            i += 1
            arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
    arr[i + 1], arr[right] = arr[right], arr[i + 1]
    return i + 1

## 3. Reverse Array (in-place)

def reverse(arr):
    left, right = 0, len(arr)-1
    while left < right:
        arr[left], arr[right] = arr[right], arr[left]
        left += 1
        right -= 1

Counter Example (not in-place):

## Merge Sort (requires extra space)

def merge_sort(arr):
    # Creates new arrays for left/right halves
    # Uses extra space for merging
    if len(arr) > 1:
        mid = len(arr) // 2
        left_half = arr[:mid]
        right_half = arr[mid:]

        merge_sort(left_half)
        merge_sort(right_half)

        i, j, k = 0, 0, 0
        while i < len(left_half) and j < len(right_half):
            if left_half[i] < right_half[j]:
                arr[k] = left_half[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                arr[k] = right_half[j]
                j += 1
            k += 1

        while i < len(left_half):
            arr[k] = left_half[i]
            i += 1
            k += 1

        while j < len(right_half):
            arr[k] = right_half[j]
            j += 1
            k += 1

Benefits:

Memory efficient
Cache friendly
Good for embedded systems
Useful for large datasets

- **Approach**: Uses divide-and-conquer, leveraging the partitioning step of QuickSort to narrow down the search space.

If you meant a different context for "Quick Select" or need details about its implementation or use with the provided array (`arr = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`), let me know! For example, I could explain how to use Quick Select to find the k-th smallest element in that array.

**Concept**: Partition-based selection algorithm to find kth element.
**When to use**:
