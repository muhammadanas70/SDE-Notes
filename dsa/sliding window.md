Great question 👍 Sliding Window is a **powerful technique** in algorithms. Let’s break it down in a **simple, visual, and code-backed way** so you’ll never forget it.

---

## 🔹 What is a “Window”?

A **window** is just a **contiguous block (subarray / substring)** inside an array or string.
When we "slide" it, we move that block one step at a time to cover the whole input.

👉 You can think of it like a **magnifying glass scanning across text line by line.**

---

## 🔹 Ways to Define a Window

1. **Fixed-size window**

   * The window has a fixed length `k`.
   * Example: Sum of every `k` consecutive elements.

2. **Variable-size window**

   * The window grows/shrinks depending on conditions.
   * Example: Longest substring without repeating characters.

3. **Overlapping windows**

   * Each window shares some elements with the previous one.

4. **Non-overlapping windows**

   * After one window ends, the next starts fresh without overlap.

---

## 🔹 ASCII Diagrams

Let’s take an **array**:

```
Index:   0   1   2   3   4   5
Array:  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]
```

### Fixed-size Window (k = 3)

```
Step 1: [1] [2] [3]  4   5   6
Step 2:  1  [2] [3] [4]  5   6
Step 3:  1   2  [3] [4] [5]  6
Step 4:  1   2   3  [4] [5] [6]
```

### Variable-size Window (grows/shrinks)

```
Start small → expand → shrink if condition breaks.
Example (longest substring without repeating chars):
"abcabcbb"

Step 1: [a]
Step 2: [a b]
Step 3: [a b c]
Step 4:    [b c a]  (shrink when repeat appears)
Step 5:      [c a b]
...
```

---

## 🔹 Python Example (Fixed-size Window Sum)

```python
def sliding_window_sum(arr, k):
    window_sum = sum(arr[:k])
    result = [window_sum]
    
    for i in range(k, len(arr)):
        window_sum += arr[i] - arr[i-k]  # slide: add new, remove old
        result.append(window_sum)
    
    return result

print(sliding_window_sum([1,2,3,4,5,6], 3))
# Output: [6, 9, 12, 15]
```

---

## 🔹 Rust Example (Fixed-size Window Sum)

```rust
fn sliding_window_sum(arr: &[i32], k: usize) -> Vec<i32> {
    let mut result = Vec::new();
    if arr.len() < k { return result; }

    let mut window_sum: i32 = arr[..k].iter().sum();
    result.push(window_sum);

    for i in k..arr.len() {
        window_sum += arr[i] - arr[i - k]; // slide window
        result.push(window_sum);
    }

    result
}

fn main() {
    let arr = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
    println!("{:?}", sliding_window_sum(&arr, 3));
    // Output: [6, 9, 12, 15]
}
```

---

✅ So a **window** = contiguous chunk of elements.
✅ We can define it as **fixed-size** or **variable-size** depending on the problem.
✅ Sliding it = shifting left/right across the array/string.

---

Would you like me to also show **ASCII diagrams for variable-size sliding windows in arrays (like longest subarray sum ≤ k)**, or keep it only to **fixed-size ones**?

Perfect 🚀 Let’s now visualize **variable-size sliding windows** (the more dynamic kind).
These are common in problems like **longest substring without repeating characters** or **maximum subarray sum ≤ k**.

---

# 🔹 Variable-Size Window (ASCII Examples)

## Example 1: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

String:

```
"abcabcbb"
```

We expand the window until a repeat appears, then shrink it from the left.

```
Step 1: [a] b c a b c b b
Step 2: [a b] c a b c b b
Step 3: [a b c] a b c b b   ✅ unique so far
Step 4: a [b c a] b c b b   ❌ 'a' repeats, shrink left
Step 5:   [b c a] b c b b   (valid again)
Step 6:     [c a b] c b b
Step 7:       [a b c] b b
Step 8:         [b c] b b   (repeat again)
```

👉 Longest unique substring = `"abc"` length = 3

---

## Example 2: Maximum Subarray Sum ≤ K

Array:

```
[2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 5],  K = 5
```

We expand until sum > K, then shrink.

```
Start: [2] 1 3 1 1 1 5   sum = 2 ✅
Expand: [2 1] 3 1 1 1 5  sum = 3 ✅
Expand: [2 1 3] 1 1 1 5  sum = 6 ❌ too big
Shrink:    [1 3] 1 1 1 5 sum = 4 ✅
Expand:    [1 3 1] 1 1 5 sum = 5 ✅
Expand:    [1 3 1 1] 1 5 sum = 6 ❌
Shrink:        [3 1 1] 1 5 sum = 5 ✅
Expand:        [3 1 1 1] 5 sum = 6 ❌
...
```

👉 Maximum window sum ≤ 5 is `5` (many windows hit this).

---

# 🔹 Python Example (Longest Unique Substring)

```python
def longest_unique_substring(s):
    seen = set()
    left = 0
    max_len = 0
    
    for right in range(len(s)):
        while s[right] in seen:   # shrink if repeat
            seen.remove(s[left])
            left += 1
        seen.add(s[right])
        max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)
    
    return max_len

print(longest_unique_substring("abcabcbb"))  # Output: 3
```

---

# 🔹 Rust Example (Longest Unique Substring)

```rust
use std::collections::HashSet;

fn longest_unique_substring(s: &str) -> usize {
    let chars: Vec<char> = s.chars().collect();
    let mut set = HashSet::new();
    let (mut left, mut max_len) = (0, 0);

    for right in 0..chars.len() {
        while set.contains(&chars[right]) {
            set.remove(&chars[left]);
            left += 1;
        }
        set.insert(chars[right]);
        max_len = max_len.max(right - left + 1);
    }
    max_len
}

fn main() {
    let s = "abcabcbb";
    println!("{}", longest_unique_substring(s)); // Output: 3
}
```

---

✅ Fixed-size windows are like a **moving box** of constant width.
✅ Variable-size windows are like a **rubber band**—stretch/shrink depending on conditions.

---

Do you want me to also **compare both (fixed vs variable window) side-by-side with ASCII + code**, so you can clearly see **when to use which**?

Awesome 😎 Let’s do a **side-by-side comparison** of **Fixed-size vs Variable-size Sliding Windows** with ASCII diagrams + code.

---

# 🔹 1. Fixed-size Sliding Window

👉 Use when the window size `k` is given.
👉 Typical problems:

* Moving average
* Max/Min sum of `k` consecutive elements
* Counting patterns of length `k`

---

### ASCII Example

Array = `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, Window size `k = 3`

```
Step 1: [1 2 3] 4  5  6   sum=6
Step 2:  1 [2 3 4] 5  6   sum=9
Step 3:  1  2 [3 4 5] 6   sum=12
Step 4:  1  2  3 [4 5 6]  sum=15
```

---

### Python (Fixed-size)

```python
def sliding_window_sum(arr, k):
    window_sum = sum(arr[:k])
    result = [window_sum]

    for i in range(k, len(arr)):
        window_sum += arr[i] - arr[i - k]
        result.append(window_sum)

    return result

print(sliding_window_sum([1,2,3,4,5,6], 3))  
# [6, 9, 12, 15]
```

---

### Rust (Fixed-size)

```rust
fn sliding_window_sum(arr: &[i32], k: usize) -> Vec<i32> {
    if arr.len() < k { return vec![]; }
    let mut result = Vec::new();

    let mut window_sum: i32 = arr[..k].iter().sum();
    result.push(window_sum);

    for i in k..arr.len() {
        window_sum += arr[i] - arr[i - k];
        result.push(window_sum);
    }

    result
}

fn main() {
    let arr = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
    println!("{:?}", sliding_window_sum(&arr, 3));
}
```

---

# 🔹 2. Variable-size Sliding Window

👉 Use when window size is **not fixed**, instead it changes with conditions.
👉 Typical problems:

* Longest substring without repeating characters
* Smallest subarray sum ≥ target
* Longest subarray with sum ≤ k

---

### ASCII Example

String = `"abcabcbb"`

```
Expand: [a]
Expand: [a b]
Expand: [a b c]   ✅ unique
Repeat: [a b c a] ❌ shrink left → [b c a]
Expand: [b c a b] ❌ shrink left → [c a b]
Expand: [c a b c] ❌ shrink left → [a b c]
...
Longest unique = "abc" length=3
```

---

### Python (Variable-size)

```python
def longest_unique_substring(s):
    seen = set()
    left = 0
    max_len = 0

    for right in range(len(s)):
        while s[right] in seen:
            seen.remove(s[left])
            left += 1
        seen.add(s[right])
        max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)

    return max_len

print(longest_unique_substring("abcabcbb"))  
# 3
```

---

### Rust (Variable-size)

```rust
use std::collections::HashSet;

fn longest_unique_substring(s: &str) -> usize {
    let chars: Vec<char> = s.chars().collect();
    let mut set = HashSet::new();
    let (mut left, mut max_len) = (0, 0);

    for right in 0..chars.len() {
        while set.contains(&chars[right]) {
            set.remove(&chars[left]);
            left += 1;
        }
        set.insert(chars[right]);
        max_len = max_len.max(right - left + 1);
    }
    max_len
}

fn main() {
    println!("{}", longest_unique_substring("abcabcbb"));
}
```

Would you like me to also add **real-world analogies** (like CCTV camera scanning vs elastic rubber band stretching) so the difference sticks in your head permanently?

Perfect 😃 — let’s lock this in your memory with **real-world analogies** so fixed vs variable sliding windows become crystal clear.

---

# 🔹 Real-World Analogies

## 1. **Fixed-size Sliding Window = CCTV Camera**

* Imagine a **CCTV camera** with a fixed frame width.
* It records exactly **3 meters** of the street at a time.
* To cover the full street, you shift the camera **one step at a time**.

👉 It **always sees exactly `k` elements** (like 3 people at a time), no matter what’s happening.

```
Street:   [A][B][C][D][E][F]
View 1:   [A B C] D  E  F
View 2:    A [B C D] E  F
View 3:    A  B [C D E] F
View 4:    A  B  C [D E F]
```

✅ Problems like “sum of 3 consecutive numbers” fit here.

---

## 2. **Variable-size Sliding Window = Elastic Rubber Band**

* Imagine stretching a **rubber band** around people standing in line.
* If everyone inside is **unique** (no repeats, no conflicts), you can stretch it further.
* If a duplicate/restricted person comes in, you **shrink the band from the left** until the condition is fixed.

👉 The **band size changes dynamically** depending on conditions.

```
Line:   A B C A B C B B
Band 1: [A]
Band 2: [A B]
Band 3: [A B C] ✅ all unique
Band 4: [A B C A] ❌ repeat → shrink → [B C A]
Band 5: [B C A B] ❌ repeat → shrink → [C A B]
...
```

✅ Problems like “longest substring without repeating characters” fit here.

---

# 🔹 Quick Mnemonics

* **Fixed-size = CCTV camera** (always fixed lens, just slides).
* **Variable-size = Rubber band** (stretches and shrinks depending on rules).

---

# 🔹 Side-by-Side with Analogies

| Feature          | Fixed-size Window (CCTV) | Variable-size Window (Rubber Band) |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Window size      | Constant `k`             | Expands/shrinks dynamically        |
| Movement         | Slide step by step       | Stretch/shrink + slide             |
| Example problem  | Sum of `k` consecutive   | Longest substring unique chars     |
| Real-world image | 📹 CCTV scanning street  | 🪢 Rubber band around people       |

---

👉 Now, when you hear “sliding window” in DSA, just ask:

* **CCTV camera?** → Fixed-size
* **Rubber band?** → Variable-size

---

Do you want me to now give you a **step-by-step “cheat sheet”** with the algorithmic templates for **both fixed and variable sliding windows** so you can reuse them in any problem?

🔥 Great choice — having **sliding window templates** is like carrying a Swiss army knife for DSA.
Let’s build your **cheat sheet** with ready-to-use **fixed-size** and **variable-size** window templates.

---

# 🔹 Sliding Window Cheat Sheet

---

## 1. Fixed-size Sliding Window (📹 CCTV Camera)

👉 Use when window size `k` is given.

### Algorithm Template

1. Compute the first window sum (or whatever metric).
2. Slide the window:

   * Add the new element (entering window).
   * Remove the old element (leaving window).
3. Repeat until the end.

### Python Template

```python
def fixed_window(arr, k):
    window_sum = sum(arr[:k])
    result = [window_sum]

    for i in range(k, len(arr)):
        window_sum += arr[i] - arr[i - k]
        result.append(window_sum)

    return result
```

### Rust Template

```rust
fn fixed_window(arr: &[i32], k: usize) -> Vec<i32> {
    if arr.len() < k { return vec![]; }
    let mut result = Vec::new();

    let mut window_sum: i32 = arr[..k].iter().sum();
    result.push(window_sum);

    for i in k..arr.len() {
        window_sum += arr[i] - arr[i - k];
        result.push(window_sum);
    }

    result
}
```

✅ Time complexity: **O(n)**
✅ Space complexity: **O(1)** (ignoring output)

---

## 2. Variable-size Sliding Window (🪢 Rubber Band)

👉 Use when window size depends on **conditions** (e.g., “sum ≤ k”, “unique characters”).

### Algorithm Template

1. Start with two pointers `left = 0`, `right = 0`.
2. Expand `right` pointer → include new element.
3. If condition is **broken**:

   * Shrink from `left` until condition is satisfied again.
4. Track answer (max/min length, count, etc.).
5. Continue until `right` reaches the end.

### Python Template

```python
def variable_window(s):
    seen = set()
    left = 0
    max_len = 0

    for right in range(len(s)):
        while s[right] in seen:   # shrink if condition broken
            seen.remove(s[left])
            left += 1
        seen.add(s[right])
        max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)

    return max_len
```

### Rust Template

```rust
use std::collections::HashSet;

fn variable_window(s: &str) -> usize {
    let chars: Vec<char> = s.chars().collect();
    let mut set = HashSet::new();
    let (mut left, mut max_len) = (0, 0);

    for right in 0..chars.len() {
        while set.contains(&chars[right]) {
            set.remove(&chars[left]);
            left += 1;
        }
        set.insert(chars[right]);
        max_len = max_len.max(right - left + 1);
    }
    max_len
}
```

✅ Time complexity: **O(n)** (each element enters/leaves window once)
✅ Space complexity: **O(n)** (for the set/dict used to track elements)

# 🔹 When to Use Which?

| If problem says…                           | Use…                     |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| “Find sum/avg/max of k consecutive items”  | **Fixed-size** window    |
| “Find longest/shortest subarray/substring” | **Variable-size** window |
| “Condition: no duplicates, sum ≤ k, etc.”  | **Variable-size** window |
| “Window size is given explicitly”          | **Fixed-size** window    |

---

⚡ Pro Tip:

* If you see **consecutive k elements → fixed window**.
* If you see **longest/shortest with condition → variable window**.

---

Would you like me to also give you **one universal Rust + Python sliding window template** where you just **plug in your condition** (like a mini framework)?
