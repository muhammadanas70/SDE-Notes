I'll create a comprehensive guide to Disjoint Set (Union-Find) data structure with complete implementations in both Python and Rust.I've created a comprehensive guide to Disjoint Set (Union-Find) implementation with complete, production-ready code in both Python and Rust. The guide covers:

**Key Features:**
- Complete implementations with path compression and union by rank optimizations
- Detailed explanations of concepts and optimizations  
- Full test suites and example usage
- Time/space complexity analysis
- Common applications and use cases
- Best practices and advanced variations

**Both implementations include:**
- `find()` with path compression
- `union()` with union by rank
- `connected()` for connectivity queries
- `get_size()` for set size queries
- `get_sets()` for retrieving all disjoint sets
- Comprehensive test cases

The implementations achieve O(α(n)) amortized time complexity for all operations, where α is the inverse Ackermann function - effectively constant time for all practical purposes.

The Python version is more straightforward and includes detailed docstrings, while the Rust version demonstrates memory safety and zero-cost abstractions with proper error handling patterns. Both are ready for production use and include extensive documentation and testing.

# Comprehensive Disjoint Set (Union-Find) Implementation Guide

## What is a Disjoint Set?

A Disjoint Set (also known as Union-Find or Merge-Find Set) is a data structure that efficiently tracks a collection of non-overlapping (disjoint) sets. It supports two primary operations:

- **Find**: Determine which set a particular element belongs to
- **Union**: Merge two sets into one

## Key Concepts

### Basic Structure
Each element initially forms its own set. As unions occur, elements are grouped together, forming larger sets. The data structure maintains a representative (root) for each set.

### Time Complexity
- **Naive Implementation**: O(n) for both operations
- **With Optimizations**: Nearly O(1) amortized time - specifically O(α(n)) where α is the inverse Ackermann function

### Space Complexity
- O(n) where n is the number of elements

## Optimizations

### 1. Path Compression
During find operations, make every node on the path point directly to the root, flattening the tree structure.

### 2. Union by Rank/Size
When unioning sets, attach the smaller tree under the root of the larger tree to keep trees shallow.

## Common Applications

### 1. Network Connectivity
Determine if two nodes in a network are connected through any path.

### 2. Kruskal's Algorithm
Used in minimum spanning tree algorithms to detect cycles.

### 3. Dynamic Connectivity
Handle queries about connectivity while edges are being added dynamically.

### 4. Percolation Theory
Model systems where connections spread through a medium.

### 5. Image Processing
Connected component labeling in computer vision.

## Advanced Variations

### Weighted Union-Find
Maintains additional information about the relationship between elements (e.g., relative distances).

### Persistent Union-Find
Allows querying the state of the data structure at any point in its history.

### Union-Find with Deletion
Supports removing elements from sets (more complex implementation required).

## Performance Analysis

| Operation | Time Complexity | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| Find | O(α(n)) amortized | α is inverse Ackermann function |
| Union | O(α(n)) amortized | Dominated by find operations |
| Connected | O(α(n)) amortized | Two find operations |

The inverse Ackermann function α(n) grows extremely slowly and is effectively constant for all practical values of n (α(n) ≤ 4 for n ≤ 2^65536).

## Best Practices

1. **Always use both optimizations**: Path compression and union by rank work together for optimal performance.

2. **Consider union by size**: Sometimes union by size (rather than rank) can be slightly more intuitive.

3. **Batch operations**: When possible, perform all unions before queries for better cache performance.

4. **Bounds checking**: In production code, add bounds checking for array accesses.

5. **Generic implementations**: Consider making the implementation generic over element types using hash maps for non-integer keys.

## Conclusion

Disjoint Set is a fundamental data structure that elegantly solves connectivity problems with near-constant time complexity. The combination of path compression and union by rank makes it practical for large-scale applications while remaining simple to implement and understand.

I'll create a detailed ASCII diagram showing how Disjoint Sets (Union-Find) work step by step, including the key operations and optimizations.I've created a comprehensive ASCII diagram showing how Disjoint Sets (Union-Find) work step by step. The diagram illustrates:

**Key Features Covered:**
1. **Initial state** - Each element as its own set
2. **Union operations** - Step-by-step merging of sets
3. **Find with path compression** - How the structure optimizes itself
4. **Union by rank** - How trees stay balanced
5. **Visual tree representations** - ASCII art showing the actual structure
6. **Algorithm pseudocode** - The actual implementation details
7. **Time complexity analysis** - Performance with and without optimizations
8. **Real-world applications** - Where this data structure is used

The diagram shows how the two key optimizations work:
- **Union by Rank**: Keeps trees shallow by always attaching the smaller tree to the larger one
- **Path Compression**: Flattens paths during Find operations, making future operations faster

This creates a data structure that supports both Union and Find operations in nearly constant time - O(α(n)) where α is the inverse Ackermann function, which is practically constant for all realistic input sizes.

# Disjoint Sets (Union-Find) Data Structure

## Initial State: MakeSet Operation
Each element starts as its own set (parent points to itself)

```
Elements: [0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]
Parent:    0   1   2   3   4   5
Rank:      0   0   0   0   0   0

Visual representation:
0    1    2    3    4    5
●    ●    ●    ●    ●    ●
```

## Step 1: Union(0, 1)
Connect elements 0 and 1. Element 1 becomes child of 0.

```
Parent: [0, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Rank:   [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Visual:
0         2    3    4    5
●         ●    ●    ●    ●
│
●
1
```

## Step 2: Union(2, 3)
Connect elements 2 and 3. Element 3 becomes child of 2.

```
Parent: [0, 0, 2, 2, 4, 5]
Rank:   [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Visual:
0         2         4    5
●         ●         ●    ●
│         │
●         ●
1         3
```

## Step 3: Union(0, 2) - Union by Rank
Both trees have same rank (1), so 2 becomes child of 0, rank of 0 increases.

```
Parent: [0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 5]
Rank:   [2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Visual:
    0           4    5
   ╱ ╲          ●    ●
  ●   ●
  1   2
      │
      ●
      3
```

## Step 4: Find(3) with Path Compression
Finding element 3 requires traversing: 3 → 2 → 0

**Before Path Compression:**
```
Path: 3 → 2 → 0
      ●   ●   ●
      3   2   0 (root)
```

**After Path Compression:**
All nodes on path point directly to root.

```
Parent: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 5]
Rank:   [2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Visual:
    0           4    5
  ╱ │ ╲         ●    ●
 ●  ●  ●
 1  2  3
```

## Step 5: Union(4, 5)
Connect elements 4 and 5. Element 5 becomes child of 4.

```
Parent: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4]
Rank:   [2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]

Visual:
    0           4
  ╱ │ ╲         ●
 ●  ●  ●        │
 1  2  3        ●
                5
```

## Step 6: Union(0, 4) - Final Union
Tree rooted at 0 has higher rank (2) than tree rooted at 4 (rank 1).
So 4 becomes child of 0.

```
Parent: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]
Rank:   [2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]

Final Visual:
      0
   ╱ │ │ ╲
  ●  ● ●  ●
  1  2 3  4
          │
          ●
          5
```

## Operations Summary

### Find(x) Operation
```
Function Find(x):
    if parent[x] ≠ x:
        parent[x] = Find(parent[x])  // Path compression
    return parent[x]

Example: Find(5)
Before: 5 → 4 → 0
After:  5 → 0 (direct connection)
```

### Union(x, y) Operation
```
Function Union(x, y):
    rootX = Find(x)
    rootY = Find(y)
    
    if rootX ≠ rootY:
        if rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]:
            parent[rootX] = rootY
        elif rank[rootX] > rank[rootY]:
            parent[rootY] = rootX
        else:
            parent[rootY] = rootX
            rank[rootX]++
```

| MakeSet   | O(1)                | O(1)              | O(1)                | O(1)      |
| Find      | O(n)                | O(log n)          | Amortized O(α(n))   | O(α(n))   |
| Union     | O(n)                | O(log n)          | Amortized O(α(n))   | O(α(n))   |

*α(n) is the inverse Ackermann function, practically constant for all realistic inputs.*

## Key Optimizations Illustrated

### 1. Union by Rank/Size
```
Bad Union (always attach right to left):
A → B → C → D    (height = 4)

Good Union (by rank):
    B
   ╱ ╲
  A   C      (height = 2)
      │
      D
```

### 2. Path Compression
```
Before Find(D):     After Find(D):
A                   A
│                  ╱│╲
B       →         B C D
│
C
│
D
```
