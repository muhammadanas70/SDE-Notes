//Named Function

function calculateTotalPrice()
const maxLimit

// Good:
const maxAttempts = 3;
// Avoid:
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  // ...
}


// Function Declaration:
   
   function calculateTotalPrice() {
     // Function body would go here
   }
   
//This is a standard function declaration in JavaScript. It defines a function named `calculateTotalPrice`.

// Function Type:
//  This is a named function. It's not an arrow function, anonymous function, or method of an object.

// How it might work:
//   Typically, a function named `calculateTotalPrice` would take some parameters (like item prices or quantities) and return the total price. 
//For example:


   function calculateTotalPrice(prices) {
     const maxLimit = 1000; // Example of using a constant
     let total = 0;
     for (let price of prices) {
       total += price;
     }
     return total > maxLimit ? maxLimit : total;
   }


// Function Call:
//   You would call this function by using its name followed by parentheses, possibly with arguments. For example:


   const itemPrices = [10, 20, 30];
   const total = calculateTotalPrice(itemPrices);
   console.log(total); // Outputs: 60


// The comments in your snippet are suggesting best practices:
//   - Using descriptive constant names (like `maxAttempts`) instead of magic numbers in loops.
//   - Avoiding hardcoded numbers in loop conditions (like `for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++)`) and instead using named constants.

//Remember, the actual implementation would depend on the specific requirements of what you're trying to calculate and how. 
//The function name suggests it's meant to calculate a total price, but the details would vary based on your specific use case.
