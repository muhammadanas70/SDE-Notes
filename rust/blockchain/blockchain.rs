Here's a rich and up-to-date overview of the **Rust ecosystem in blockchain development**, showcasing notable open-source projects where Rust powers everything from full blockchain platforms to tooling and cryptography:

---

## Major Rust-Based Blockchain Platforms & Frameworks

* **Substrate** – A modular Rust framework by Parity Technologies for building custom blockchains, offering features like forkless upgrades, consensus mechanisms, and on-chain governance ([HackerNoon][1], [Medium][2]).

* **Polkadot** – A scalable multi-chain platform built on Substrate, enabling parachains with shared security and interoperability ([CoinMarketCap][3], [Wikipedia][4]).

* **Solana** – High-performance blockchain designed for DeFi and dApps, featuring low latency through Proof of History, built in Rust ([CoinMarketCap][3]).

* **Elrond** – Scalable PoS blockchain using Rust for node software, with Adaptive State Sharding consensus for high throughput ([CoinMarketCap][3]).

* **NEAR Protocol** – Developer-friendly, scalable smart contract platform built with Rust, featuring sharding and parallel processing ([CoinMarketCap][3], [Binance][5]).

* **Zcash** – Privacy-focused blockchain using Rust for its core node software, leveraging zero-knowledge proofs ([CoinMarketCap][3]).

* **Secret Network** – Privacy-first blockchain supporting encrypted smart contracts and secure computation, implemented in Rust ([CoinMarketCap][3]).

* **Nervos Network** – Multi-layer, PoW blockchain with smart contract capability, built using Rust ([Wikipedia][6]).

* **Holochain** – A distributed applications framework running without centralized servers, written in Rust ([Wikipedia][7]).

## Blockchain Utilities, Clients & Tooling

* **Rust Bitcoin**, **Lighthouse**, **Electrs** – Tools and clients for Bitcoin and Ethereum ecosystems in Rust (parsing, consensus, and servers) ([Rustfinity][8]).

* **Foundry**, **revm**, **ethers-rs**, **Artemis** – Rust-based toolkits for Ethereum application development, EVM implementation, smart contract interaction, and MEV bot frameworks ([Rustfinity][8]).

* **Forest** – Filecoin node implementation in Rust ([Rustfinity][8]).

* **Tendermint-RS**, **Hermes IBC Relayer** – Rust implementations of Tendermint consensus engine and Cosmos IBC relayer ([Rustfinity][8]).

---

## Broad Blockchain Project Collections

The **“Awesome Blockchain Rust”** repository offers a categorized and extensive list of blockchain-related Rust projects, including:

* **Blockchains**: Aleo, Aleph Zero, Anoma, Aptos, Casper, Chainflip, CITA, Exonum, Fuel, Gear, Grin, Holochain, Internet Computer, and more ([GitHub][9]).

* **Cross-Chain & Virtual Machines**: Tendermint ABCI, Orga, IBC, CosmWasm, CKB-VM, FuelVM, Wasmi, Lunatic, Polygon Miden ([GitHub][10]).

* **P2P, Consensus, Cryptography, Layer-2, DApps**: Full-scope resources across the Rust blockchain ecosystem ([rustinblockchain.org][11]).

---

## Community Highlights & Supporting Libraries

From community spotlights:

* **jsonrpsee** – Asynchronous JSON-RPC library by Parity for blockchain networking ([Reddit][12]).

* Notable systems include **Anoma**, **Nova (recursive SNARKs)**, **Winterfell (STARK prover/verifier)**, and **LibraBFT simulator** for consensus modeling ([Reddit][12]).

* **bip32.rs** – Rust implementation of hierarchical deterministic wallet derivation (BIP‑32/BIP‑39) ([Reddit][13]).
